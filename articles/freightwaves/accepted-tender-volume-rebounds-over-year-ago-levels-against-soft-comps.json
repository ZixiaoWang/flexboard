The Outbound Tender Volume Index (OTVI) still remains well below year-ago levels, albeit against puzzling comps.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"428\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1-1200x428.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416540\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1-1200x428.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1-600x214.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1-768x274.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1-1536x548.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1.png.webp 1761w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Tender volumes contract early in Q2</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em>SONAR: OTVI.USA: 2021-22 (blue), 2020-21 (green) and 2019-20 (orange)</em><br><em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>,<strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>OTVI declined by 4.54% over the past week and is down 12.48% on a year-over-year (y/y) basis. As heavily discussed in this column throughout March, OTVI does not necessarily measure true freight flow in the market, as it can be inflated by an uptick in tender rejection rates. Last year’s OTVI was indeed greatly inflated by rising tender rejections, a trend that began in mid-February and was sustained until deep in the summer of 2021. In contrast, current rates of tender rejections are in virtual free fall and rapidly approaching single-digit percentages — a phenomenon not seen in nearly two years.</p><p>Turning to accepted tender volumes, which is OTVI adjusted by the Outbound Tender Reject Index (OTRI), we see growth of 3.2% y/y but also a decline in equal measure week-over-week (w/w). The difference between y/y comparisons of OTVI and accepted volume cannot be explained by a falling OTRI alone: OTRI had a local peak in 2021 on March 28, when accepted volume in 2022 was up by a meager 0.75% y/y.</p><p>Rather, a few factors seem to be at play here. First is the perplexing “dead cat bounce,” when a bearish market falsely appears to be entering a sustained recovery. Since truckload freight is heavily influenced by ocean imports, which react to changing market conditions more slowly than trucking due to differences in transportation time, a backlog of said imports continues to trickle through the ports. This backlog worsened as shippers rushed to get their imports out of Shanghai, which was placed under targeted COVID lockdowns a few weeks prior.</p><p>Second, the freight market took an inexplicable breather one year ago, despite a round of stimulus payments driving consumer demand for goods. The market quickly rebounded the following week, so expect to see a return to unfavorable y/y comparisons next week if this trend is merely a false spring. Third, produce season provides relative insulation from market downturns, since perishable goods have to ship and people have to eat.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1-1200x567.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416542\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1-1200x567.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1-600x283.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1-768x363.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1-1536x726.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1.png.webp 1681w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Volumes are rising across many smaller markets</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: Outbound Tender Volume Index – Weekly Change (OTVIW).</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br></em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>, </em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>The third-largest market by outbound volume, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, saw a large increase in volume by 13.65% w/w.

Major seaports on the West Coast, however, were not as fortunate, since outbound volume fell 8.8% w/w in Ontario, California.</p><p><strong>By mode:</strong> Following the trend of the overall OTVI, both reefer and dry van volumes are down on a w/w basis. The Reefer Outbound Tender Volume Index (ROTVI) is down 4.55% this week and down 27.8% y/y against an inflated ROTVI from last year. Accepted reefer volumes, however, are currently up 6.4% y/y, showing that produce season is indeed underway. The story is similar to the Van Outbound Tender Volume Index (VOTVI), which is down 4.84% w/w and 12.1% y/y. Accepted van volumes, on the other hand, are up 3.5% y/y.</p><p><strong>Rejection rates fall stepwise closer to single-digit levels</strong></p><p>It should alarm carriers that, only two weeks prior, OTRI was at an already shocking 15%.

Maintenance costs in particular are troublesome because many carriers cannot afford to upgrade their fleets with newer trucks, given the ongoing semiconductor crisis and corresponding hike in prices of used equipment.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"COLs28CM1PcCFWhAwgUdJ_QLIg\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1-1200x565.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416544\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1-1200x565.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1-600x283.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1-768x362.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1-1536x724.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1.png.webp 1685w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Capacity tightens in Baltimore, loosens elsewhere</em>:</em></em> </em></em></em></em></em></em><br><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: </em>WRI (color)</em></em></em></em></em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The map above shows the Weighted Rejection Index (WRI), the product of the Outbound Tender Reject Index — Weekly Change and Outbound Tender Market Share, as a way to prioritize rejection rate changes.

Capacity conditions in the reefer market are also easing, as the Reefer Outbound Tender Reject Index (ROTRI) fell 195 bps w/w to 20.24%.</p><p><strong>Contract rates have yet to budge, though spot rates are tumbling</strong></p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674488081-0\" data-google-query-id=\"COPs28CM1PcCFWhAwgUdJ_QLIg\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"5\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>The spot rate data available in SONAR from Truckstop.com is updated every Tuesday with the previous week’s data.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"458\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOPVRPM-1-1200x458.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416547\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOPVRPM-1-1200x458.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOPVRPM-1-600x229.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOPVRPM-1-768x293.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOPVRPM-1-1536x586.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOPVRPM-1.png.webp 1667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Spot rates have fallen dramatically since February’s peak</em></em></em>:</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: Truckstop.com’s national spot rate (blue, right axis) and dry van contract rate (green, left axis).</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The Truckstop.com national spot rate, based on the top 100 lanes on Truckstop.com’s load board, continued to drop as capacity loosened across the markets. The national spot rate, after reaching an all-time high of $3.83 per mile in early January, now sits at just $3.29 a mile, which includes fuel surcharges and other accessorials.</p><p>Of the 102 lanes from Truckstop.com’s load board, 30 reported spot rate increases last week, up from 25 lanes the week prior. This decline in the average spot rate, coupled with the unstoppable rise in contract rates, is likely to help shift pricing power into shippers’ favor.</p><p>In early March, contract rates set a record high at $2.97 per mile, though they have since fallen by a negligible amount. Contract rates, which are the base linehaul rate excluding fuel surcharges and other accessorials that are included in spot rates, remain unchanged from last week’s levels, sitting at $2.94 a mile.</p><p>Until last week, FreightWaves’ Trusted Rate Assessment Consortium (TRAC) spot rate from Los Angeles to Dallas had yet to experience any correction, as the downward spiral in rates continued uninterrupted since the beginning of 2022. This week, the rate rose 5 cents per mile to $2.90. Carriers and shippers alike have been wondering where this lane’s floor for rates was, and since rates are finally leveling out, it might be here. A dramatic increase in this lane, especially when compared to 2021’s $4-plus-per-mile rates, is not expected anytime soon.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LAX-DAL-1200x413.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416548\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LAX-DAL-1200x413.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LAX-DAL-600x206.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LAX-DAL-768x264.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LAX-DAL.png.webp 1355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em>SONAR: FreightWaves TRAC rate from Los Angeles to Dallas.</em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves TRAC, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/freightwaves-trac-trusted-rate-assessment-consortium\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The FreightWaves TRAC spot rate from Atlanta to Philadelphia, on the other hand, did fall this week, responding to loosened capacity in the Atlanta region.

In general, however, spot rates are going to fall as freight demand peters out. Since contract rates are reported on a two-week lag, it is possible that shippers will push for lower rates in their Q2 negotiations, given that pricing power is increasingly swaying in their favor. Should contract rates drop, it is unlikely that rejection rates will rise dramatically in response, given the dire outlook facing many smaller and newer carriers.</p><p>For more information on the FreightWaves Freight Intel Group, please contact Kevin Hill at <a href=\"mailto:khill@freightwaves.com\">khill@freightwaves.com</a> or Tony Mulvey at <a href=\"mailto:tmulvey@freightwaves.com\">tmulvey@freightwaves.com</a>.</p><p></p><div class=\"upcoming_events\"><div class=\"upcoming_left\"><h2>Register today for the Future of Supply Chain #FOSC22</h2><p>The leading voices in supply chain are coming to Rogers, Arkansas, on May 9-10.</p><p><i>*limited term pricing available.</i></p></div><div class=\"upcoming_right\"> <a href=\"https://bit.ly/FOSCTickets-Article\" target=\"_blank\">Learn More</a></div></div><div class=\"post-bottom-meta post-bottom-tags post-tags-modern\"><div class=\"post-bottom-meta-title\"><span class=\"tie-icon-tags\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span> Tags</div><span class=\"tagcloud\"><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/2022-freight-recession\" rel=\"tag\">2022 freight recession</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/carriers\" rel=\"tag\">carriers</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/contract-rates\" rel=\"tag\">contract rates</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/freight-volume\" rel=\"tag\">Freight volume</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/freightwaves-trac\" rel=\"tag\">FreightWaves TRAC</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/pricing-power-index\" rel=\"tag\">Pricing Power Index</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/shippers\" rel=\"tag\">Shippers</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/spot-rates\" rel=\"tag\">spot rates</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/truckload-capacity\" rel=\"tag\">truckload capacity</a></span></div>"}
