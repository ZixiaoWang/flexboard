Production in 2021 was the highest on record, by far, at 7.18 million twenty-foot equivalent units, according to Drewry. Production in 2022 “is well below last year’s pace,” said John O’Callaghan, Triton’s global head of marketing and operations.</p><p>Liner companies “have been more cautious about growing their container [equipment] fleets this year,” said Sondey.

Three months ago, <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/supply-chain-signals-new-container-production-and-pricing-finally-peak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">when Triton last reported quarterly results</a>, it was down to $3,400 per TEU.

Sondey described July 2021 container pricing highs as “a condition we’ve never seen before,” noting that “the market just can’t stay at that level forever.”</p><p>For liners that lease new containers from companies like Triton, as opposed to ordering them on their own account, lease rates are likewise down from 2021 highs. “Container prices are now reflected in leasing rates as well,” confirmed Sondey.</p><p>Liners took boxes on lease from Triton for average durations of 12-13 years in 2021. Duration has pulled back to 10 years in 2022. “I think that just reflects container prices coming back down to Earth a little bit,” said Sondey. “When container prices … are no longer close to $4,000, it’s easier to spread the premium [over fewer years].”</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CN683JyP1PcCFZkOXAodwIIDrw\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><h2 id=\"h-secondhand-container-equipment-market\">Secondhand container equipment market</h2><p>Another key indicator is the sale price of old containers that come off leases and are disposed of in the secondary market (for use as storage, etc.).</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/triton-chart2-1200x663.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-424735\" width=\"528\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/triton-chart2-1200x663.jpg.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/triton-chart2-600x331.jpg.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/triton-chart2-768x424.jpg.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/triton-chart2-1536x848.jpg.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/triton-chart2-2048x1131.jpg.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\"><figcaption>Chart: Triton Q1 2022 presentation.

Typically, what we see with a disruption is that the same amount of goods wants to flow. And when you see temporary disruptions, that means there are peak periods when things are flowing higher. That tends to mean shipping lines need more containers in their fleet relative to the cargo they’re moving. But I don’t think anyone is brave enough to forecast how this plays out.”</p><h2 id=\"h-triton-earnings\">Triton earnings</h2><p>Stocks in the various segments of ocean container shipping have been pulling back since late March and early April despite expectations for record first-quarter earnings and continued strong earnings through the rest of the year.</p><p>Triton is a case in point: It posted record net income of $181.2 million for Q1 2022, versus net income of $129.3 million in Q1 2021.
