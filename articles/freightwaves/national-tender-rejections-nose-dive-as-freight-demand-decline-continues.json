The Outbound Tender Volume Index (OTVI) posted levels slightly below those of last week and remains far below year-ago levels.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1200x426.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-414260\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1200x426.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-600x213.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-768x273.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-1536x545.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI.png.webp 1769w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Tender volumes suffer from unseasonable contraction</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em>SONAR: OTVI.USA: 2021-22 (blue), 2020-21 (green) and 2019-20 (orange)</em><br><em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>,<strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>OTVI declined by 1.81% over the past week and is down 14.6% on a year-over-year (y/y) basis. From the current economic perspective, there are few points of optimism for freight volume making a recovery in Q2 — which is not to say that there are none. The final weeks of tax season are upon us and refund checks will be in the mail over the coming weeks. Per the IRS, the average tax refund last year was $2,815.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether that money will be spent on retail goods or squirreled away into savings depends on consumers’ optimism or lack thereof. Although the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index slightly rebounded in March from a dip in the month prior, its Expectation Index (which measures consumers’ short-term economic outlook) did fall. All told, spring retail sales are likely to suffer, though the decline could be softer than the worst fears of some.</p><p>Turning to accepted tender volumes, which is OTVI adjusted by the Outbound Tender Reject Index (OTRI), we see only minuscule growth by 0.72% y/y and 0.38% week-over-week (w/w). Given that OTVI can be inflated by a rising OTRI and that tender rejections in 2021 were far above those in the present year, March’s weakened OTVI had looked more favorable on a y/y basis when comparing accepted tender volumes. No more is that the case: Real freight demand is on a steady decline.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1200x559.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-414262\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1200x559.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-600x280.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-768x358.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map-1536x716.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-Map.png.webp 1687w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Red blankets the map, indicating weekly declines in regional freight demand</em>:</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: Outbound Tender Volume Index – Weekly Change (OTVIW).</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br></em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>, </em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>This week was another in which the largest markets saw either contraction or little growth, with most of the w/w increases coming from the smaller markets. Of the 135 total markets, only 58 reported weekly increases. Not only did Savannah, Georgia, see a 4.95% increase in outbound volume w/w, but it also posted month-over-month (m/m) growth for the 19th consecutive month. As a result of the swell in imports battering the Port of Savannah, <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/port-of-savannah-marks-19th-month-of-higher-container-volumes\">the Georgia Ports Authority has moved to expedite over $538 million toward capacity expansion projects.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Tender volume is down by 6.47% w/w in the important market of Ontario, California, which handles freight from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Setting aside the larger trend of dampened freight volume, shippers are increasingly receiving their imports at seaports on the East and Gulf coasts, fearing the much-publicized congestion at their West Coast counterparts. <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/east-coast-ports-about-to-get-slammed-by-a-lot-more-ships\">A recently released report anticipates </a>that in 2022, imports from Asia heading to the East Coast will rise 40% y/y and 56% over the average from 2020.

As spring weather increasingly melts the winter thaw, shippers are relying less on temperature-controlled units. The Reefer Outbound Tender Volume Index (ROTVI) is down 3.83% this week and down 29.1% y/y, albeit against difficult comps from last year. The Van Outbound Tender Volume Index (VOTVI), meanwhile, posted moderate levels this week, down 2.35% w/w and 14.5% y/y.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rejection rates remain in free fall with no floor approaching</strong></p><p>OTRI continues to plummet, darting past 15% and sinking close to 13% this week.

Unlike other industries — for example, grocery, internet services and consumer electronics — the trucking industry is not dominated by a handful of heavyweights but is diversified among many small businesses. As of February 2021, out of all the carriers registered with the FMCSA, only 2.6% operated fleets with 20 or more trucking units; 91.5% had fleets of six or fewer trucks. This diversity leaves small carriers vulnerable to rapid shifts in freight demand, especially if they operate primarily in the spot market. Should tender rejections continue to fall, many of these carriers will buckle under an unbalanced account sheet and go bankrupt.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1200x557.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-414266\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1200x557.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-600x278.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-768x356.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI-1536x713.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WRI.png.webp 1683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Capacity loosens significantly in Atlanta, the largest outbound market</em>:</em></em> </em></em></em></em></em></em><br><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: </em>WRI (color)</em></em></em></em></em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The map above shows the Weighted Rejection Index (WRI), the product of the Outbound Tender Reject Index — Weekly Change and Outbound Tender Market Share, as a way to prioritize rejection rate changes.

Over the past year, carriers had been flocking to the Los Angeles region, tempted by a hot spot market driven by ocean imports and sustained by congestion at the seaports. At the beginning of March, freight demand in Ontario plummeted while volumes in Atlanta rose, making for an awkward period of adjustment as carriers relocated to Atlanta.

This week, the rate rose 2 cents per mile to $2.85. Carriers and shippers alike might have been wondering where this lane’s floor for rates was, and since rates are finally leveling out, it might be here. There is still a chance for rates to fall even lower; an increase in rates, however, is not expected anytime soon.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LAX-DAL-1-1200x379.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-412093\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LAX-DAL-1-1200x379.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LAX-DAL-1-600x190.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LAX-DAL-1-768x243.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LAX-DAL-1.png.webp 1355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em>SONAR: FreightWaves TRAC rate from Los Angeles to Dallas.</em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves TRAC, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/freightwaves-trac-trusted-rate-assessment-consortium\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The FreightWaves TRAC spot rate from Atlanta to Philadelphia, on the other hand, did fall this week, responding to loosened capacity in the Atlanta region.

Unlike trends in the larger economic cycle, the boom-bust cycle in the truckload market typically follows a three-year pattern. The last bust for the trucking industry was, appropriately, three years ago in 2019.
