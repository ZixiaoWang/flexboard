On a year-over-year (y/y) basis, OTVI is down 16.75%. Comparisons on a y/y basis can be thorny because OTVI can be inflated by an uptick in tender rejections. At this time last year, OTVI was greatly inflated by rising tender rejections, whereas rejection rates have since nosedived to incredible lows.</p><p>Looking at accepted tender volumes, which is OTVI adjusted by the Outbound Tender Reject Index (OTRI), we see growth of only 0.3% y/y as well as growth by 8.3% on week-over-week (w/w) basis — the latter w/w growth, again, came against easy comps. The y/y picture for accepted volume may not appear grim, but the overall freight market is historically strong during the run-up to summer. The current limping state of the market, on the other hand, should concern carriers.</p><p>The Chinese government appears to be gearing up for extended COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and, given recent school closings, possibly Beijing. The Port of Shanghai is the busiest container port in the world; any disruptions to its operations would have severe ripple effects on global supply chains. At first glance, the Port of Shanghai does not seem to be majorly impacted by the ongoing lockdowns — average dwell times for exports are currently at a little more than two days, well below the average of three days over the past year.</p><p>Part of these low dwell times can be explained by the lack of goods flowing into the port, as productivity at manufacturing plants and the movement of truck drivers are both heavily restricted by the lockdowns. There is a likely accumulation of goods that are languishing in nearby warehouses or that have yet to be produced by factories in Shanghai. This accumulation is a ticking time bomb: Once it is able to be delivered to the terminals, <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/crisis-or-hiccup-assessing-the-logistics-impact-of-china-lockdowns\">the port will be inundated with excess cargo and will then be unable to operate efficiently</a>.</p><p>Another cause for concern will be <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/viewpoint-china-covid-policies-to-squeeze-flow-of-european-exports-to-north-america\">the limited supply of empty containers caused by restricted freight flow at Chinese ports</a>. Shipments from China to Europe are already being delayed, inhibiting the gross number of containers that can be delivered, unloaded and, in turn, reloaded and shipped to the United States. Any curb on trade between Europe and the U.S. is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, a reduction in new vessel arrivals will allow East Coast seaports to tackle the backlog of cargo that is currently congesting them. On the other, this reduction could kick the can further down the line, as exporters on the East Coast would eventually have a limited supply of empty containers themselves. Whatever the case, the lockdowns in China are threatening to extend well into the summer.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW.MAP_-1200x565.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-423648\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW.MAP_-1200x565.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW.MAP_-600x282.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW.MAP_-768x361.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW.MAP_-1536x723.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW.MAP_.png.webp 1677w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Volumes rise across the board</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: Outbound Tender Volume Index – Weekly Change (OTVIW).</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br></em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>, </em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>Of the 135 total markets, 100 reported weekly increases after volumes recovered from the Easter lull.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CIzeufLQ2fcCFYzDlgodJFAOCQ\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Since last week was quite barren, freight demand this week faced favorable comps on a w/w basis. Volumes returned to the ports: Charleston, South Carolina, was up 23.4%; Los Angeles was up 7.77%; and Houston was up 4.96%. Volumes also returned to the largest markets: Atlanta was up 10.2%; Ontario, California, was up 6.63%; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was up 6.41%.</p><p>There were, however, a few markets to which this bounty of freight volume was not extended. Lakeland, Florida — the state’s largest market by outbound volume — was the only market in the state to experience contraction this week, with volumes falling nearly 2% w/w. The Indianapolis market, a Midwestern hub for manufacturing, saw volumes decline 2.14% w/w after a recent survey expressed Hoosier manufacturers’ concerns about their ability to overcome supply chain disruptions and to contend with the rising costs of material inputs.</p><p><strong>By mode:</strong> Reefer volume took a tumble this week as the Reefer Outbound Tender Volume Index (ROTVI) fell 6.7% w/w. Lakeland, Florida — the nation’s largest outbound market for reefer freight — saw its own ROTVI decline 3.1% w/w after a sharp rise and fall early in the week. Dry van volumes, however, bounced back and the Van Outbound Tender Volume Index (VOTVI) rose 6.9% w/w accordingly. In produce-heavy markets, such as those in the Southeast, reefer volumes should be sustained by seasonal patterns — after all, demand for food is fairly inelastic.</p><h2><strong><strong>Tender rejections finally fall to sub-10% levels and show no signs of slowing</strong></strong></h2><p>Although treading water above 10% at the beginning of the week, OTRI quickly fell into single-digit percentages before the week’s end. Excepting the onset of the 2020 pandemic, OTRI’s current trend marks both the steepest and longest decline in a non-holiday-affected period.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-2-1200x443.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-423650\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-2-1200x443.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-2-600x222.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-2-768x284.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-2-1536x567.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-2.png.webp 1730w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Rejection rates sink into the single digits</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em>SONAR: OTRI.USA: 2021-22 (blue), 2020-21 (green) and 2019-20 (orange)</em><br><em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>, </em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past week, OTRI, which measures relative capacity in the market, fell to 8.82%, a change of 138 basis points (bps) from the week prior.

Carriers playing primarily within the spot market already are exposed to volatile rate swings and reduced demand for spot freight, but to make matters worse, they typically have to eat the cost of fuel as part of their all-in rate. Yet even carriers running contracted loads still face the pressure of diesel hikes, since they normally pay for fuel at the point of sale while fuel surcharges can take months to reimburse them. That period of waiting for reimbursement can be crucial, since other monthly costs cannot be deferred so easily: insurance expenses, maintenance costs and, if the carrier’s equipment is not paid off, debt servicing.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CI3eufLQ2fcCFYzDlgodJFAOCQ\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Larger carriers often buy fuel at discount, wholesale prices and then charge elevated retail prices for their surcharges, but the trucking industry as a whole is dominated by smaller carriers.

FOTRI currently sits at 29.22%, 304 bps higher on a y/y basis. In Illinois (and probably elsewhere), it was commonly joked that there were two seasons: winter and construction. Construction season is already well underway, with new residential and nonresidential construction heating up to levels not seen since 2006. Moreover, high crude prices are driving investment into oil drilling. Accordingly, flatbeds will be in great demand for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Rejection rates in the other two modes, dry van and reefer, have continued along a protracted decline that began in early March. The Van Outbound Tender Reject Index (VOTRI) is now at 8.7%, 124 bps lower on a w/w basis and 1,642 bps lower y/y. Following the trend in ROTVI, the Reefer Outbound Tender Reject Index (ROTRI) is down 479 bps this week to 11.43%, a whopping 3,307 bps below year-ago levels.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674488081-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CI7eufLQ2fcCFYzDlgodJFAOCQ\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"5\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><h2><strong>Contract rates show signs of following spot rate trend, declining rapidly w/w</strong></h2><p>The spot rate data available in SONAR from Truckstop.com is updated every Tuesday with the previous week’s data.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOP-1-1200x457.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-423656\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOP-1-1200x457.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOP-1-600x229.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOP-1-768x293.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOP-1-1536x585.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TSTOP-1.png.webp 1677w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Contract rates are hit hard by Q2 repricing</em></em></em>:</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: Truckstop.com’s national spot rate (blue, right axis) and dry van contract rate (green, left axis).</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The bottom has yet to be found on dry van spot rates. To borrow yet another analogy from roller coasters, any carrier wearing a waterproof poncho is painfully dry as it waits for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_Mountain\">the Splash at the end of the Mountain</a>. Truckstop.com’s national all-in dry van spot rate, which is based on the top 100 lanes from Truckstop.com’s load board, fell 8 cents per mile this week to $2.94 per mile, including fuel surcharges and other accessorials.&nbsp;</p><p>This week marks the first time that the rate has fallen below $3 a mile since February 2021. For context, the national rate averaged around $2.10 a mile prior to the pandemic, almost 30% lower than the current rate. While the gap between then and now might seem insurmountable, keep in mind that spot rates have already fallen 23% from their peak in early January. Diesel prices will, however, continue to provide upward pressure on spot rates. In short, spot rates are unlikely to return to $2.10 a mile, but they might soon be moving into the same neighborhood.</p><p>Of the 102 lanes from Truckstop.com’s load board, only 19 reported weekly increases, up from last week’s 13 lanes but not up enough to provide relief to carriers. The most drastic increases were found on peripheral lanes in New England: For example, Syracuse, New York, to Hartford, Connecticut, jumped 25 cents per mile to $4.39 a mile, well above the national average.</p><p>Ever since the supply chain disruptions early in the pandemic, shippers have been increasingly shifting their contract bid cycles to shorter periods so as to keep better pace with a volatile market. Now that data has come in from the Q2 renegotiations, it is clear that shippers have realized their newfound pricing power. Contract rates, which are the base linehaul rate excluding fuel surcharges and other accessorials that are included in spot rates, fell 9 cents per mile to $2.81 a mile. This decline bodes ill for those carriers hoping that contract rates would insulate them from the rapid decline seen in the spot market. Nevertheless, contract rates are still up 16.1% y/y, so all is not yet lost for those carriers.</p><p>There are also the backhaul lanes to consider, many of which have hit their floor on rates and are now steadily increasing. Of these lanes, Dallas to Los Angeles is one of the most interesting, since it shares some characteristics with a backhaul lane but not others. Dallas is currently the third-largest outbound market in the country, yet carriers are covering loads from it to Los Angeles at rates near their operational cost. Because of that razor-thin margin, spot rates (which include fuel surcharges) on this lane are mainly affected by shifting diesel prices.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613676843897-0\"> <script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1613676843897-0\"); });</script> </div></div><p>As a result, FreightWaves’ Trusted Rate Assessment Consortium (TRAC) spot rate from Dallas to Los Angeles has risen only 2 cents per mile over the past week to $1.90 but has spiked by 52 cents per mile over the past six months. These increases translate to a 1.1% gain w/w and a 37.7% gain over a six-month period. Meanwhile, diesel prices have risen by a comparable 1.2% w/w and by 38.4% over a six-month period.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DAL-LAX-1200x412.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-423660\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DAL-LAX-1200x412.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DAL-LAX-600x206.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DAL-LAX-768x264.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DAL-LAX.png.webp 1363w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em>SONAR: FreightWaves TRAC rate from Dallas to Los Angeles.</em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves TRAC, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/freightwaves-trac-trusted-rate-assessment-consortium\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The opposite is true for rates along headhaul lanes, where carriers had a comfortable margin above their operating costs.
