Hutchinson is the current chair of the National Governors Association. He is the former co-chair of the Council of Governors and the former chairman of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, Southern States Energy Board and the Southern Regional Education Board.</p><p><strong>Jonathan Hoffman&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With more than 20 years of experience in communications, government, business and law, Hoffman has demonstrated expertise in national defense and homeland security policies and programs, public affairs, crisis communications, and government relations.</p><p>He recently served as the assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. In this role he was responsible for Department of Defense (DOD) strategic communications planning and public affairs execution, was the principal adviser to the secretary of defense for all public relations and crisis communications issues and was the chief Pentagon spokesman.</p><p>Prior to joining the DOD, Hoffman served in a similar role at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as assistant secretary of homeland security for public affairs. Hoffman also served as the Emergency Support Function-15 (External Affairs) coordinator for the entire federal government in times of national crisis.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CIGO7-yn1PcCFRjLfAod26QCag\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Previously, he served as the deputy assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at DHS, and as the director of international programs and border security policy at the White House.

He was a co-founder at two startups – a politics-focused social media platform and a public sentiment data analytics SaaS provider.</p><p>“I am excited to be a keynote speaker at The Future of Supply Chain in May,” Hoffman said. “I have been working with FreightWaves for the last several months and have come to appreciate the complexity and importance of an industry many people – until the last two years – took for granted because it always delivered with zero public attention.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hoffman added, “With worldwide economic upheaval due to COVID-19, Russia’s effective excommunication from the global economy as a result of its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the explosion of disruptive supply chain technology, this event will be a well-timed opportunity to talk about how the global supply chain community must continue to adapt and enhance resilience to better serve clients and customers in a less predictable world of escalating risk.”</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1-1200x675.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-405445\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1-1200x675.jpg.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1-600x338.jpg.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1-1536x864.jpg.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1-390x220.jpg.webp 390w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Future-of-Supply-Chain-Identity-1.jpg.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></figure></div><p><strong>The Future of Supply Chain</strong></p><p>A celebration of technology and innovation, The Future of Supply Chain – to be held at the Rogers Convention Center – will bring together thought leaders from all sectors of the supply chain to share their experiences, predictions and expertise during live interviews and fireside chats.
