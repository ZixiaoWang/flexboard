On Tuesday, Gatik co-founder and CEO Gautam Narang touted the accomplishments of the firm so far to an engaged audience at FreightWaves’ Future of Supply Chain conference at the Rogers Convention Center in Rogers, Arkansas.</p><p>“In 2017, when we started the company, we had two things in mind,” Narang told the audience. “The first one was [to] focus on the application that was more near term, and then at the same time, let’s solve a customer pain point.</p><p>“In 2016, most of the industry players were focusing on passenger transportation. Everyone was promising by 2020, 2021 we would have tens of thousands of robotaxis on the roads. Everyone was promising the problem would be solved. Everyone was saying 2021 is the year. Today, standing here in 2022, somehow the promises are being made for 2024 and 2025. We are always three to four years out.”</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1-1200x675.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Gatik autonomous box truck parked in front of Walmart store.\" class=\"wp-image-427116\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1-1200x675.jpg.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1-600x338.jpg.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1-1536x864.jpg.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1-390x220.jpg.webp 390w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gatik-Fully-Driverless-infront-of-walmart-store-1.jpg.webp 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption>Gatik has been running autonomous box trucks without a human in the driver’s seat since August 2021 in Arkansas in partnership with Walmart.

It is the movement of goods from distribution center to distribution center  or retail location that enables the last mile to be successful. In Gatik’s case, the company is working several pilots, including the<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/gatik-bids-adieu-to-safety-drivers-in-fully-driverless-walmart-pilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> one with Walmart</a> and another in Louisiana.

And this year and next, we plan to scale that across multiple sites, multiple customers.”</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535422102-0\" data-google-query-id=\"COyk4vLN2fcCFc6Slgod0ygIww\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot2_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot2_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot2_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"2\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>The Arkansas pilot with Walmart sees the Gatik vehicle navigate a 7.1-mile route from a Walmart dark store (a store that stocks items for fulfillment but isn’t open to the public) to a Walmart neighborhood market in Bentonville.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h3 id=\"h-related\">Related:</h3><h4 class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color\" id=\"h-read-2021-set-the-stage-for-supersonic-growth-for-gatik\">Read:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2021-set-the-stage-for-supersonic-growth-for-gatik\">2021 set the stage for ‘supersonic’ growth for Gatik</a></h4><h4 class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color\" id=\"h-read-gatik-fully-removes-the-driver-from-its-autonomous-trucks\">Read:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/gatik-fully-removes-the-driver-from-its-autonomous-trucks\">Gatik fully removes the driver from its autonomous trucks</a></h4><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><p>Additional pilots are being developed, including a current one with<a href=\"https://www.loblaw.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Loblaw Cos.</a> (<a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/L.TO/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TSX: L.TO</a>) in Ontario, Canada, and a recent collaboration with a major distributor.

There are the over-the-road pilots, the middle mile and the final mile.</p><p>“One is the long haul, which is mostly focused on Class 8, mostly interstate, driving only on highways,” he said. “If you look at most of the players focused on Class 8, they have to disengage their system as soon as they leave the highway. On the other end of the spectrum, you have these slower and smaller robots making deliveries to the customer doorstep. The challenge … is you have to solve for delivery for every possible combination to the customer’s doorstep.”</p><h2><strong>Repeatable routes</strong></h2><p>Gatik is tackling that middle portion, moving items from a distribution center to a distribution center or a store. They are repeatable, fixed routes that allow the technology to become familiar with its environment.</p><p>“Why does it matter? Why do we believe this is going to be the critical segment of the supply chain?” he asked. “We really look at this, as everything is driven by end consumer expectations, and end consumers want their deliveries in the next one hour, the next two hours, or in the very latest the next day, and that is forcing the whole supply chain to move closer to the customer. And that is not just in the grocery space, not just in retail, it is happening across the supply chain, in distribution, CPG and e-commerce as well.”</p><p>Like the new pilot with the distributor, Narang sees middle-mile autonomous box trucks — which do not require CDLs — replacing some percentage of regional routes.</p><p>“That traditional route that was initially served by a Class 8 doing one or two routes a week has now been transformed into multiple deliveries every day and making more frequent deliveries,” Narang said. “And it does not make sense to operate a Class 8 semi-truck to make these deliveries. Now this single route has now transformed into multiple routes, and there is a need for more drivers, more trucks and more trips. Given the driver shortage today — it is so hard to find drivers — automation is the answer.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CO6k4vLN2fcCFc6Slgod0ygIww\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>“This is what we see as the future of delivery, the future of the supply chain,” he concluded.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/author/brianstraight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click for more articles by Brian Straight.</a></p><h2>You may also like:</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/drones-are-flying-into-weather-data-deserts-can-they-be-stopped\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Drones are flying into weather data deserts.
