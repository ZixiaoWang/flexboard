Most importantly, the effects are quite persistent, peaking after a year and lasting up to 18 months. This implies that the increase in shipping costs observed in 2021 could increase inflation by about 1.5 percentage points in 2022,” the study’s authors, Yan Carriere-Swallow, Pragyan Deb, Davide Furceri, Daniel Jimenez and Jonathan D.

Our <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/03/25/Shipping-Costs-and-Inflation-515144\">new research</a> shows that the inflationary impact of those higher costs is poised to keep building through the end of this year.”</p><p>The analysis was conducted prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they noted. “The conflict will likely exacerbate global inflation.”</p><p>The researchers explained in the blog that “while the pass-through to inflation is less than that associated with fuel or food prices … shipping costs are much more volatile. As a result, the contribution in the variation of inflation due to global shipping price changes is quantitatively similar to the variation generated by shocks to global oil and food prices.”</p><p>They said the analysis showed that “higher shipping costs hit prices of imported goods at the dock within two months and quickly pass through to producer prices — many of whom rely on imported inputs to manufacture their goods.”</p><p>“But the impact on the prices consumers pay at the cash register builds up more gradually, hitting its peak after 12 months,” they wrote. “This is a much slower process than what is seen after a rise in global oil prices, which drivers feel at the pump within a couple of months.”</p><p>That FreightWaves/American Shipper article in late October said that “inflation watchers will keep a sharp eye on ocean shipping, if not as a price driver then as a bellwether of what happens next. The rise in trans-Pacific spot rates and the number of ships off Los Angeles/Long Beach did coincide with rising consumer price inflation. The same correlation could hold on the way down.”</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CKzRp4am1PcCFQiB6QUd3YQOFg\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Stifel analyst Ben Nolan said in a report: “At some point, port congestion will go away.
