Statistical analysis today plays a powerful role in forming the best teams.</p><p>Fans, owners and players have a deep emotional connection to the sport — and that’s exactly why data analysis can be so useful: It can take the emotion out of decision-making. In fact, it helped a small-market team like the Oakland A’s win six American League West Division titles.</p><p>“We had a great platform to use data in an emotional, visceral business,” said Billy Beane, executive vice president of baseball operations for the Oakland A’s. Beane was a keynote speaker during Day 1 of FreightWaves’ Future of the Supply Chain summit in northwest Arkansas.</p><p>Beane and FreightWaves founder and CEO Craig Fuller on Monday discussed the role data played in creating a team that would win multiple division titles in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>Beane’s story and those of others involved in leading the Oakland A’s <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/michael-lewis-marketwaves-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">were the subject</a> of the book “Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,” by Michael Lewis. The book became an <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moneyball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Academy Award-nominated film</a> in 2012, with Brad Pitt playing Beane.</p><p>The book and the movie describe Beane’s “Moneyball” philosophy, which looks at how organizations can effectively, efficiently and profitably manage their assets, talents and resources for short- and long-term gain.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535422102-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CJe4_d3O2fcCFbzJFgUd-WcK4Q\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot2_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot2_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot2_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"2\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>“We follow sports because we get emotional about it. We make decisions with our eyes. And as executives, we did the same thing despite the fact that we had all this data sitting out there for years,” Beane said.</p><p>Beane, a retired baseball player, started as a first-round draft pick of the New York Mets in 1980 before playing six major league seasons as an infielder, outfielder and catcher for the Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers and the A’s. His final season was 1989 as a utility player on the A’s World Championship team. After working within the A’s front office as a major league advance scout, he eventually became the club’s general manager in 1997.</p><p>In that role, he hired Harvard graduate Paul DePodesta as assistant general manager. Through DePodesta, played by actor Jonah Hill in the movie, Beane transitioned to using data to acquire talent.&nbsp;</p><p>“[By] about the mid-’90s, when we went from one of the highest-payroll teams to one of the lowest, we had to find a different way to do things. Otherwise, we were destined to finish where our payroll said we should,” Beane said.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-1200x675.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Billy Beane, a man with grey hair and wearing a dark suit, talks to Craig Fuller, a man wearing a blue suit.\" class=\"wp-image-426591\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-1200x675.jpg.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-600x338.jpg.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-1536x864.jpg.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-2048x1152.jpg.webp 2048w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_4004-390x220.jpg.webp 390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption>FreightWaves CEO and founder Craig Fuller (left) chats with Billy Beane, (right) an EVP with the Oakland A’s.

We actually thought it was completely the opposite. We felt like using data gave us the answers to the test. We felt like we were basically conservative,” Beane said. “We were trying to run a baseball team like actuaries set insurance rates. So for us, the risk would have been guessing when we had the information there in the form of data.”</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CJi4_d3O2fcCFbzJFgUd-WcK4Q\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>As the A’s success grew and its data-informed methods expanded, so did the use of data by competing teams.&nbsp;</p><p>After the book’s release, “chasing statistics then became the norm … . What ultimately happened with ourselves and other teams over the course of the next decade after the book was [that it led] really smart people to create player performance models, and they were all proprietary. And that’s really what dominated the next decade with a lot of teams,” Beane said. “And then, ultimately, after 10 years, most teams had their own in-house proprietary models very similar to Wall Street firms.”</p><p>Although all teams now use data to some degree to make decisions, Beane said, there is still some magic in traditional approaches. The use of scouts as well as data is a powerful combination, he said.</p><p>Using scouts “is very much a part of the fabric of baseball, and it goes back years when a scout would go watch a player and make a judgment,” Beane said. “With smart people [doing data analysis], we’ve been able to incorporate those opinions … . They’re weighted differently.”</p><h4 id=\"h-related-links\">Related links:</h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/michael-lewis-marketwaves-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Author Lewis, whose books often highlight the growing role of data, sees the opportunity in trucking</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/freightwaves-releases-national-trucking-index-to-measure-domestic-truckload-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FreightWaves releases National Trucking Index to measure domestic truckload market</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/freight-market-moneyball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Freight Market Moneyball</a></li></ul><p></p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CJm4_d3O2fcCFbzJFgUd-WcK4Q\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p></p><div class=\"post-bottom-meta post-bottom-tags post-tags-modern\"><div class=\"post-bottom-meta-title\"><span class=\"tie-icon-tags\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span> Tags</div><span class=\"tagcloud\"><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/2022-future-of-supply-chain\" rel=\"tag\">2022 Future Of Supply Chain</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/billy-beane\" rel=\"tag\">Billy Beane</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/data\" rel=\"tag\">data</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/major-league-baseball\" rel=\"tag\">Major League Baseball</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/moneyball\" rel=\"tag\">Moneyball</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/oakland-as\" rel=\"tag\">Oakland A's</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/statistics\" rel=\"tag\">statistics</a></span></div>"}
