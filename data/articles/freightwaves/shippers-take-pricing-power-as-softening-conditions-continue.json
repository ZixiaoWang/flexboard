April is traditionally softer than March, as shippers tend to increase tender volume levels right before the end of the first quarter. The increase to close the Q1 didn’t occur, but April tender volumes remain light compared to March.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-2-1200x449.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-421272\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-2-1200x449.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-2-600x224.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-2-768x287.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-2-1536x575.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVI-2.png.webp 1767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Tender volume levels continue their descent</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em>SONAR: OTVI.USA: 2021-22 (blue), 2020-21 (purple) and 2019-20 (green)</em><br><em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>,<strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>OTVI declined by nearly 5% over the past week, but a significant portion of the drop occurred on Friday of last week, leading into the holiday weekend. Removing that drop, tender volumes have continued their decline over the week, dropping 2.3% since Friday. OTVI is down 22.25% year-over-year (y/y), but the comps are quite difficult because OTVI as a metric includes both accepted and rejected tenders, thus when rejection rates are tremendously high like they were throughout 2021, OTVI is artificially propped up.</p><p>Adjusting OTVI by the rejection rate allows for a clearer picture of true freight volumes moving throughout the country. Accepted tender volumes have turned negative within the past two weeks, indicating that the softening of freight volumes is happening but not as rapid as the decline in OTVI. Accepted tender volumes currently sit about 5% below year-ago levels. Just in the past month, accepted tender volumes have declined by more than 7%, again not as fast as OTVI but concerning nonetheless as we enter what is typically one of the stronger periods for freight.</p><p>There has been a lot of talk over the past several weeks about the softening of the freight market, especially with the rates of change in spot rates, rejection rates and OTVI. The important thing to note is that OTVI tracks the contracted freight market closely, though there are some spot loads included in the index. The softness in the freight market is stemming from the spot market, which leads the contract market in directional moves. So while the spot market has shown signs of softening, the contract market had been holding up relatively well.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CNGD1PbQ2fcCFZjSlgodnCUCiA\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>The freight market is set for volatility over the next few months as consumer spending slows and lockdowns in China allow for the U.S. ports to catch their breath. <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/get-ready-for-the-next-supply-chain-shockwave\">The lockdown in Shanghai</a>, of which no one knows the length of time, could place immense strain on supply chains, leading to tremendous backlogs at the ports once again.</p><p>Whenever China does turn back on, it may not be an instantaneous release valve, as numerous ships currently off the coast of Shanghai contain vital raw materials used in the manufacturing of goods.&nbsp;</p><p>Once those goods leave China and are stateside the challenges for freight demand start to intensify. Prologis, one of the leading warehousing companies, released the company’s first-quarter earnings earlier this week, reporting that 98.3% of the company’s available U.S. square footage was leased and 97.6% was currently occupied. There were four markets where 100% of the available square footage was leased: Central Valley, California, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Nashville, which combine to total 9.5% of the company’s U.S. footprint.</p><p>Slower consumer spending combined with record inventory levels is leading to shippers to shift modes of transportation, opting for the rails. The time-sensitive nature that most shippers faced to get goods to market over the past year is dwindling, causing the shift. Shippers tend to use the far cheaper intermodal option when time isn’t of the essence, in an effort to not only save money but also limit inventory within warehouses, using containers effectively as moving warehouses. This shift has started as loaded domestic intermodal container volumes actually held up throughout March and early April, while OTVI has been falling. This signals that intermodal marketing companies (IMCs) are in a position to take advantage of a softening truckload market in the coming months.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-1-1200x539.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-421276\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-1-1200x539.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-1-600x269.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-1-768x345.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-1-1536x690.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTVIW-1.png.webp 1672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Volumes are rising across many smaller markets</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>:<br><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>SONAR: Outbound Tender Volume Index – Weekly Change (OTVIW).</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br></em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>, </em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>Of the 135 total markets, however, only 37 reported weekly increases, down from last week’s 55 that reported increases.&nbsp;</p><p>The largest markets in the country experienced tender volume levels decline over the past week with the exception of Ontario, California, which has been able to piece together consecutive w/w volume gains.

Both Harrisburg and Dallas experienced a 5% decline in tender volumes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>By mode:</strong> For the first time in several weeks, dry van volumes have underperformed reefer volumes over the past week.

As produce season rapidly approaches, reefer tender volumes may see an uptick from reduced capacity numbers, which will in turn cause rejection rates to level off from the rapid decline, but that hasn’t appeared to have happened yet.</p><p><strong>Carrier compliance improves, but threatens small carriers with spot market exposure</strong></p><p>The downward decline in tender rejection rates over the past six weeks is both the largest and fastest decline in tender rejection rates in over 2 years, with only the decline at the onset of COVID-19 being more severe.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-1-1200x457.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-421277\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-1-1200x457.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-1-600x228.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-1-768x292.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-1-1536x585.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OTRI-1.png.webp 1726w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Rejection rates sink, almost hitting 10%</em></em></em></em></em></em></em><br><em>SONAR: OTRI.USA: 2021-22 (blue), 2020-21 (green) and 2019-20 (orange)</em><br><em><strong>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR</strong>, </em><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past week, OTRI, which measures relative capacity in the market, has started to stall out, falling just 64 basis points (bps) w/w, to 10.43%.

In Elizabeth, New Jersey, home of the second largest port complex, rejection rates fell 201 bps w/w, to 6.63%, about 900 bps below the Q1 average.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VOTRI-3-1200x454.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-421279\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VOTRI-3-1200x454.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VOTRI-3-600x227.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VOTRI-3-768x290.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VOTRI-3-1536x581.png.webp 1536w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VOTRI-3.png.webp 1737w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em>SONAR: VOTRI.USA (blue); ROTRI.USA (orange); FOTRI.USA (green)</em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/sonar-demo-request?utm_source=FreightWaves&amp;utm_medium=Editorial&amp;utm_campaign=SONAR\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p><strong>By mode:</strong> After taking a slight breather to start the month, the flatbed market has started to heat up once again.

Over the past week, Truckstop.com’s national all-in dry van spot rate based on 100 lanes from Truckstop.com’s load board fell another 14 cents per mile, to $3.02 per mile, accelerating from last week’s 13 cents per mile decline. Since peaking the week of Jan. 9 at $3.83/mi, Truckstop.com’s national spot rate has been cut by more than 20%, the fastest decline in the dataset. The national average spot rate is currently at the lowest level since February 2021, prior to the freeze that severely disrupted transportation networks, currently sitting six cents per mile lower than this time last year.</p><p>Of the 102 lanes from Truckstop.com’s load board, just 13 reported weekly increases, down from last week’s already staggeringly low 17 lanes that reported increases. Westbound lanes out of Texas were among the increases with Houston to Denver leading the way, increasing by 24 cents per mile to $3.23.</p><p>The spot market always leads the contract market in terms of rates given the bid cycles that shippers, carriers and brokers all participate in. The severe decline in spot rates and rejection rates haven’t led to contract rates slowing, at least yet anyways. The initially reported van contract rate, which is reported on two-week lag and represents just the base linehaul rate, erased last week’s decline, rising 6 cents per mile to $2.96.&nbsp;</p><p>Contract rates continue to perform admirably compared to the previous year, currently up 20% y/y, a gap that has been maintained for much of the past six months. Contract rates are slower to react to market conditions, but as spot rates cross over contract rates, the rate of growth for contract rates will stall or could turn negative after the dramatic increase in the upcoming months.</p><p>There has been limited relief for shippers on backhaul lanes, especially those headed into Los Angeles, though there has been relief on the outbound moves from Southern California in recent weeks.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRAC-DENLAX-2-1200x421.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-421284\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRAC-DENLAX-2-1200x421.png.webp 1200w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRAC-DENLAX-2-600x210.png.webp 600w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRAC-DENLAX-2-768x269.png.webp 768w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRAC-DENLAX-2.png.webp 1363w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption><em>SONAR: FreightWaves TRAC rate from Denver to Los Angeles.</em><br><strong><em>To learn more about FreightWaves TRAC, </em></strong><a href=\"https://sonar.freightwaves.com/freightwaves-trac-trusted-rate-assessment-consortium\"><strong><em>click here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>The FreightWaves Trusted Rate Assessment Consortium (TRAC) spot rate from Denver to Los Angeles tells quite the opposite story of normal freight markets.

Over the past week, the FreightWaves TRAC spot rate fell 15 cents per mile to $1.57, the lowest the rate has been since early October. Since March 1, the rate is down 29 cents per mile, indicating carriers are more willing to take lower rates eastbound to ensure assets are being utilized.&nbsp;</p><p>The Los Angeles to Dallas lane, one of the densest lanes in transportation, continues to creep lower. The FreightWaves TRAC spot rate along this lane has fallen another 8 cents per mile this week, to $2.78. Since the beginning of the year, the rate along this lane has fallen by 31% from north of $4 per mile to well under $3/mi, with no signs of upward movement.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the slope that rates are currently on hasn’t shown signs of slowing down in the data, especially as rejection rates move rapidly toward 10%. As rejection rates continue to slide and tender volumes follow suit, look for spot rates to continue down the ski slope started in mid-February.</p><p>For more information on the FreightWaves Passport, please contact Kevin Hill at <a href=\"mailto:khill@freightwaves.com\">khill@freightwaves.com</a> or Tony Mulvey at <a href=\"mailto:tmulvey@freightwaves.com\">tmulvey@freightwaves.com</a>.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://ratings.freightwaves.com/carriers/\">FREIGHTWAVES TOP 500</a> For-Hire Carriers list includes <a href=\"https://ratings.freightwaves.com/carriers/j-b-hunt/\">J.B.
