The returned aircraft include two Boeing 747-400 freighters, a 747-8 freighter and a 757-200 converted freighter.&nbsp;</p><p>The 747-400s were operated by Sky Gates Airlines and taken back by Silk Way West Airlines.

IBA said Air Lease has recovered three aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S., European Union and United Kingdom have imposed widespread sanctions on Russia’s aviation sector, including the closure of airspace to Russian-owned or -controlled aircraft; prohibiting exports of technology, spare parts and services; and freezing the operation of Boeing and Airbus aircraft by Russian carriers.&nbsp;</p><p>The EU also ordered aircraft lessors to terminate their lease agreements with Russian carriers by March 28.&nbsp;</p><p>Russian airlines had about 513 aircraft worth $10 billion leased from non-Russian lessors at the start of the conflict, according to IBA. The number of foreign-managed aircraft operated by Russian entities decreased to 484 by the March 28 deadline for lease terminations. More than 400 of these aircraft are currently located in Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>The 32 aircraft that have left Russia since the invasion and been returned to non-Russian lessors include three that were subleased to Russian airlines. IBA said it believes several aircraft are currently being returned to leasing companies in May.&nbsp;</p><p>AerCap has had the most success recovering aircraft and reducing its exposure in Russia, according to IBA.

In mid-March, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law circumventing moves by Bermuda and Ireland, where most foreign-leased aircraft operating in Russia are registered, to nullify <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bermuda-suspends-flight-certificates-for-russian-registered-aircraft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the airworthiness certificates of Russian-operated aircraft</a> over concern that sanctions degraded their ability to verify the planes were safe to fly.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kremlin ruling allows Russian carriers to transfer Western-made aircraft to the Russian aviation registry and use the foreign aircraft to fly domestic routes, making it more difficult for leasing companies to recover their aircraft. The legislation violates international law, which requires aircraft be deregistered from the original registry and operators get the owner’s permission before they can be placed on another registry.</p><p>IBA said it had identified nearly 300 aircraft with terminated leases, about 60% of the foreign-owned Russian fleet, that were active during the third week of April, mostly operating on domestic routes inside Russia.</p><p>Aviation analysts say Russian operators risk permanently poisoning relationships with foreign lessors.</p><p>Airspace restrictions in Western countries have made it extremely difficult for leasing companies to retrieve their aircraft because they can’t send people to fly them out and engage with technical specialists on the ground about upkeep. Appraisal and financial experts also say that the value of leased aircraft is falling without access to aircraft maintenance records.&nbsp;</p><p>As Russian airlines continue to operate these foreign-owned aircraft, they will burn downtime until major maintenance without the ability to pay for them and diminish the value of the aircraft, said Peter Walter, IBA’s director of technical and asset management, in a March webinar.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"COGRweek1PcCFUHKvQod3gcLEw\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>With little chance of recovering assets trapped in Russia or ever earning any revenue from them, leasing companies have begun filing billions of dollars worth of insurance claims. AerCap recently filed a claim for $3.5 billion for its fleet stranded in Russia and said it also expects to take an impairment charge.</p><p>AerCap, the world’s largest aircraft lessor, had the largest exposure of any leasing company to Russia, with 5% of its fleet assigned to Russian airlines.</p><p>The Air Lease aircraft are unlikely to ever be used in commercial service outside of Russia where they could be repossessed, according to aviation and financial industry experts.</p><p>Air Lease said it “does not expect that the write-off of these assets will result in material future cash expenditures for the company” and that it is “vigorously pursuing insurance claims to recover losses relating to these aircraft.”</p><p>How long it will take to secure insurance proceeds is unclear. Insurers have canceled the policies of some lessors, including for war risk, and are likely to challenge claims on coverage still in place, according to media reports.
