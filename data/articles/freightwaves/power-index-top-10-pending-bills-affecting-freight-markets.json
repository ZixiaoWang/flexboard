Both bills are aimed at promoting U.S. exports, with the House bill implementing stronger provisions to help ensure export cargo is not unreasonably declined by carriers.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: The legislation would expand the Federal Maritime Commission’s oversight of ocean carriers in the<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ocean-carriers-shipping-reform-act-doomed-to-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> first major overhaul to the Shipping Act</a> since 1998. It addresses complaints by U.S. exporters that their markets are being harmed by ocean carrier pricing and service decisions that favor the carriers’ import trades. Ocean carriers contend, however, that such government intrusion would disrupt, rather than improve, supply chains that work best when carriers are free to make pricing and operational decisions based on supply and demand. Washington insiders believe that, because the bills have strong bipartisan support in both chambers, the legislation has a reasonably good chance of passing. The House version of the bill secured another path to become law after John Garamendi, D-Calif., one of its original sponsors, secured it as an amendment to the America Competes Act (see below).</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h3 id=\"h-truck-parking-safety-improvement-act\">Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act</h3><h4 id=\"h-h-r-2187\">H.R. 2187</h4><p><strong>Co-sponsors</strong>: 28 (11 Democrats, 17 Republicans)</p><p><strong>Status</strong>: Introduced March 29, 2021, referred to committee.</p><p><strong>Mode affected</strong>: Trucking.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: The bill would authorize the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide parking on federal highways for commercial trucks.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CIzwxYeO1PcCFVMNXAodXKcNrw\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/buttigieg-outlines-potential-truck-parking-funding-opportunities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> outlined several provisions</a> within the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure law that could be used to provide funds expanding truck parking, but they all compete with other safety programs or infrastructure project proposals. This legislation, originally introduced by Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., would provide the first competitive grants — $755 million over five years — dedicated specifically for truck parking, a high-priority issue that has strong support from the American Trucking Associations and the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. Both groups promoted the bill in a<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ata-ooida-team-up-on-parking-letter-sent-to-buttigieg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> recent letter</a> to Buttigieg.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h3 id=\"h-facilitating-relief-for-efficient-intermodal-gateways-to-handle-transportation-freight-act\">Facilitating Relief for Efficient Intermodal Gateways to Handle Transportation (FREIGHT) Act</h3><h4 id=\"h-s-3262\">S. 3262</h4><p><strong>Co-sponsors</strong>: six Republicans.</p><p><strong>Status</strong>: Introduced on Nov. 18, 2021, referred to committee.</p><p><strong>Modes affected</strong>: Ocean shipping, intermodal rail and trucking.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: Address ongoing freight challenges while putting in place policies to support the transportation network in the long term.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: A flurry of Republican bills were introduced late last year ostensibly to address short-term supply chain disruptions, but most were seen as holiday-season protests against an alleged lack of action by the Biden administration to deal with freight bottlenecks. The FREIGHT Act attempts to move beyond the short term by including provisions that its sponsors believe can address more systemic problems, particularly at U.S. ports. Its main provision would establish a grant program for port authorities aimed at standardizing terms and documents used in port operations to improve the ability of marine terminals to notify shippers, railroads and truck drayage companies when cargo is available for transfer.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CI3wxYeO1PcCFVMNXAodXKcNrw\"> <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div> </div></div><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h3 id=\"h-customs-trade-partnership-against-terrorism-c-tpat-pilot-program-act\">Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Pilot Program Act</h3><h4 id=\"h-house-h-r-6826-senate-s-2322\">House: H.R. 6826/Senate S. 2322</h4><p><strong>Co-sponsors</strong>: House bill: three (one Democrat, two Republicans). Senate bill: five (three Democrats, two Republicans)</p><p><strong>Status</strong>: The House bill passed out of the Homeland Security committee on March 2. The Senate bill passed the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee.</p><p><strong>Modes affected</strong>: Ocean shipping, rail, trucking and airfreight.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: Creates a pilot program for 10 DOT-licensed property brokers and 10 warehouse entities to be C-TPAT certified.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: The C-TPAT program is a government-industry partnership created in the aftermath of 9/11 to expedite freight through the country and reduce disruptions of international supply chains while keeping the border secure. However, it excluded non-asset-based 3PLs from participating, which they contend puts them at a competitive disadvantage. These bills — which passed their respective committees with strong bipartisan support — would help 3PLs and freight brokers grow their businesses by putting them on more equal footing with asset-based competition.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h3 id=\"h-hydrogen-for-ports-act-of-2021\">Hydrogen for Ports Act of 2021</h3><h4 id=\"h-s-3111\">S. 3111</h4><p><strong>Co-sponsors</strong>: six (four Democrats, two Republicans)&nbsp;</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674488081-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CI7wxYeO1PcCFVMNXAodXKcNrw\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot5_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"469\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"5\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong>Status</strong>: Introduced on Oct. 28, 2021, referred to committee.</p><p><strong>Mode affected</strong>: Ocean shipping.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: Requires the secretary of Energy to establish a grant program to support hydrogen-fueled equipment at ports and to conduct a study with the secretary of Transportation and the secretary of Homeland Security on the feasibility and safety of using hydrogen-derived fuels, including ammonia, as a shipping fuel.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Global shipping is under pressure to decarbonize maritime transportation but has hit a wall with fossil-based fuels in trying to meet the international target of at least a 50% reduction (compared to 2008) in carbon emissions by 2050. The container shipping industry<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/is-green-ammonia-fit-to-decarbonize-shipping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> considers hydrogen and ammonia</a> as potential ways to meet that goal while acknowledging that technical questions on safety, storage and distribution remain unanswered.

It requires President Joe Biden’s<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/biden-to-investigate-transportation-supply-demand-mismatches\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force</a> to evaluate the economic and environmental effects of cargo backlogs at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as develop a plan to “significantly reduce or eliminate the backlogs and reduce nationwide cargo processing delays.” In addition, an amendment to the bill bans all Russian vessels from the territorial waters of the U.S., a provision added in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h3 id=\"h-ocean-shipping-antitrust-enforcement-act\">Ocean Shipping Antitrust Enforcement Act</h3><h4 id=\"h-h-r-6864\">H.R. 6864</h4><p><strong>Co-sponsors</strong>: eight (six Democrats, two Republicans)</p><p><strong>Status</strong>: Introduced March 1, referred to two committees.</p><p><strong>Mode affected</strong>: Ocean shipping.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> A bill to amend Title 46, United States Code, to repeal certain antitrust exemptions for ocean common carriers.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: This two-page bill is short but packs a punch: If signed into law, it would deal a<a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/new-legislation-would-strip-ocean-carrier-antitrust-protections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> significant blow to the major ocean carrier alliances</a> that rely on a certain amount of antitrust immunity — immunity not available in other industry sectors — to plan and deploy shared vessel capacity and to discuss pricing to respond to changes in supply and demand.
