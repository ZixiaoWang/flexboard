Meanwhile, available cargo space on aircraft shrank 4% year-over-year and is now 14% less than before the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Cargo capacity contracted after Western sanctions forced Russian cargo airlines AirBridgeCargo and Sky Gates Airlines to shut down, Russia closed its airspace, a Ukrainian carrier focused on humanitarian airlift and airlines canceled flights due to omicron quarantines in China.</p><p>Clive Data said it identified a 20% drop in Europe-to-Northeast Asia capacity during the first few weeks following the Russian invasion. <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/lufthansa-sees-10-capacity-cut-due-to-russia-flight-detours\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lufthansa Cargo officials estimate a 10% reduction in air cargo capacity</a> because airlines must fly extra hours around Russia, carry more fuel that displaces cargo or make a fuel stop. The International Air Transport Association measured a 17% fall in the number of dedicated cargo flights between Asia and Europe during late March versus the same period a year ago.</p><p>And logistics companies in China say the citywide lockdowns of Shanghai, Kunshan and other areas have <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/another-china-lockdown-jeopardizes-electronics-auto-supply-chains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">made it nearly impossible for the air logistics system to function</a>. Shanghai Pudong International Airport is technically open, but few special licenses are being issued for truckers to enter airport property and no shipments can be released or delivered. Factory production has plummeted.

Spot rates and spot market share versus space sold at contract rates, for example, continued to rise on the Europe-Japan trade lane. Spot rates from Japan climbed in the last week of March to about $5.47 per kilogram, nearly 50% higher than in the weeks preceding the Ukraine war. And the amount of capacity being sold at spot rates increased to nearly 60% or 20 points higher than the spot share in early February.</p><p>The North Atlantic market is showing considerable strength. The load factor, or percentage of occupied cargo space, in March was 83%, only 5 points lower than the record in March 2021. The modest decrease in the load factor despite a 40% increase in year-over-year capacity reflects a 25% increase in volumes from Europe to North America, according to Clive.</p><p>Air cargo volumes have been boosted for more than a year by businesses converting ocean shipments to air because of systemic inefficiencies and backlogs precipitated by the pandemic. Much of the diversion has been on the main trade lanes of Asia to the U.S. and Europe, but the same trend appears to be happening in the trans-Atlantic. East Coast ports are experiencing extremely low vessel reliability and mounting congestion as companies try to avoid bigger logjams on the U.S. West Coast. Vessels are arriving an average of 9.5 days late, according to Xeneta.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1550535506376-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CPWOscCN1PcCFYEFXAodfR4DHg\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot3_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"61\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Demand for air freight in Europe is increasing as companies look to air transport to ensure adequate inventory stocks for the summer and fall, third-party logistics provider Flexport said in its weekly market update. The freighter deficit means shippers have to wait 10 to 14 days from the time of booking until cargo gets on a flight, especially on popular trade lanes. Cheaper options are available to secondary European hubs where airlines have regular passenger flights, it said.</p><h3><strong>IATA’s February market view</strong></h3><p>Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association flagged several indicators for slower air cargo growth <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-reports/air-freight-monthly-analysis---february-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in its latest market performance report</a>, which showed global demand in February was 11.9% greater than in 2019 and 2.9% more than the prior year.</p><p>During 2021, air cargo demand increased 6.9% compared to precrisis levels.</p><p>IATA uses a different methodology than Clive that critics say doesn’t truly capture volumes because it uses distance rather than volumetric measurements as part of its formula. It also lags Clive by a month because it depends on airlines to report figures as opposed to using current transaction data.</p><p>Economic caution signs are everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>The factory closures in Asia, sanctions, supply chain delays and shortages of crucial inputs are driving prices higher — and economic activity and trade lower. The same shortages and shipping delays, however, are also why more companies are resorting to air transport.</p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613674425335-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CPaOscCN1PcCFYEFXAodfR4DHg\">  <div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/21776187881/fw-responsive-main_content-slot4_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" srcdoc=\"\" data-google-container-id=\"4\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Consumer inflation for G7 countries was 6.3% in February, the highest level in 40 years. Inflation typically reduces purchasing power for goods, but IATA economists said higher savings levels during the pandemic might change the pattern. A contraction in global export orders to the lowest level since July 2020 is another cautionary sign.</p><p>Inflation may already be dampening new export orders — a leading indicator of demand for air cargo shipments and strongly correlated with cargo-ton kilometers. In March, global export orders contracted to the lowest level since July 2020. IATA pointed to a noticeable deterioration in new export orders in Germany, China, Japan and Korea.</p><p>“Sanction-related shifts in manufacturing and economic activity, rising oil prices and geopolitical uncertainty will take their toll on air cargo’s performance,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh in a statement.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"h-international-belly-cargo-and-freighter-capacity-growth\">International belly cargo and freighter capacity growth</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-220954.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"416063\" data-full-url=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-220954.png.webp\" data-link=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/?attachment_id=416063\" class=\"wp-image-416063\" srcset=\"https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-220954.png.webp 700w, https://s29755.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-06-220954-600x382.png.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></figure></li></ul></figure><p>Air cargo volumes could get a bump once mass quarantines in China end because warehouses and factories will try to make up for the downtime and pump out more exports.

The Ukraine crisis broke too late in February to be reflected in IATA’s figures. Ticket sales point to a strong summer season. Still uncertain is whether inflation, and lower consumer confidence tied to Ukraine war effects, will slow the industry’s recovery. Airlines are raising fares to offset jet fuel prices, which have soared 77% this year, more than the price of crude oil.</p><p>But IATA Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen said strong pent-up demand and the fact that fares are still lower than they’ve been historically could mean consumers keep flying.&nbsp;</p><p>Cargo space on international passenger flights increased 21.4% year-over-year in February, but gains are slowing as traffic normalizes. Overall, IATA said cargo capacity was 12.5% better in February than a year earlier, in line with the past four months, but remained tight, 5.6% below the 2019 level.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/author/erickulisch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>More FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.</em></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Subscribe to the American Shipper Air newsletter.</em></a></p><p><strong>RECOMMENDED READING:</strong></p><div class=\"stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter\"><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1613676843897-0\"> <script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1613676843897-0\"); });</script> </div></div><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/another-china-lockdown-jeopardizes-electronics-auto-supply-chains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Another China lockdown jeopardizes electronics, auto supply chains</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/volga-dnepr-freezes-boeing-freighter-operations-over-russia-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volga-Dnepr freezes Boeing freighter operations over Russia sanctions</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/omicron-weather-dent-air-cargo-growth-in-january\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Omicron, weather dent air cargo growth in January</a></p><div class=\"upcoming_events\"><div class=\"upcoming_left\"><h2>Register today for the Future of Supply Chain #FOSC22</h2><p>The leading voices in supply chain are coming to Rogers, Arkansas, on May 9-10.</p><p><i>*limited term pricing available.</i></p></div><div class=\"upcoming_right\"> <a href=\"https://bit.ly/FOSCTickets-Article\" target=\"_blank\">Learn More</a></div></div><div class=\"post-bottom-meta post-bottom-tags post-tags-modern\"><div class=\"post-bottom-meta-title\"><span class=\"tie-icon-tags\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span> Tags</div><span class=\"tagcloud\"><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/air-cargo-market\" rel=\"tag\">air cargo market</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/air-freight\" rel=\"tag\">air freight</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/covid-19\" rel=\"tag\">COVID-19</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/iata\" rel=\"tag\">IATA</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/russia-ukraine\" rel=\"tag\">Russia-Ukraine</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/russian-sanctions\" rel=\"tag\">Russian sanctions</a> <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tag/xeneta\" rel=\"tag\">Xeneta</a></span></div>"}
