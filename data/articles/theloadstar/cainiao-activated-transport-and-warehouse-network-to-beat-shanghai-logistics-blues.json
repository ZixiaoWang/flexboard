We were afraid we wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver goods on time, so we activated our warehouses. At present, deliveries haven\u2019t been greatly affected.\u201d</p>\n<p>Preparations were also made to ensure that Cainiao\u2019s truck drivers had appropriate passes and negative Covid-19 test results to cross into other cities.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerchants suffer a loss every minute logistics services are suspended. Fortunately, with the successive issue of access passes and the inclusion of express delivery companies in the \u2018white list\u2019, the operational efficiency of Shanghai \u2018s express logistics industry is gradually recovering.\u201d</p>\n<p>The challenges in Shanghai are far from over, however, as the port city has been locked down since 28 March amid China\u2019s Covid-zero policy.</p>\n<p>Cainiao said: \u201cAt the critical stage of epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production, Cainiao will work with merchants and logistics partners to overcome difficulties. We will fight the tough battles against Covid-19 and against the logistical bottlenecks.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>To hear more about logistics disruption in Asia, listen to this clip from The Loadstar Podcast of Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk.</em></p>\n<p><br/>\n<audio controls=\"controls\" data-project44-podcast-clip=\"true\"><source src=\"https://episodes.castos.com/61e078fee345f1-77268395/36802/3d0a7455-c78f-4942-a74f-75b23c35af85/EP7-News-2022-Clip-4.-Lockdowns-disruption-spreading-to-South-East-Asia.-Lars-Mikael-Jensen-Head-of-Global-Ocean-Network-at-Maersk.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>\n</article>"}
