Ti said this was driven by strong demand for PPE towards the end of the year, as well as supply chain bottlenecks in sea and land transport.</p>\n<p>In sea freight forwarding, Ti noted how growth opportunities were lost due to \u201ca shortage of carrier capacity and port congestion\u201d. As a result, the market grew by 6.6%, to $156.5bn, while freight rates were up 69.8%, due to demand being \u201cconsiderably higher than available capacity\u201d.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Ti said, port congestion had created a \u201cmismatch between supply and demand\u201d and slowed growth in the sea freight market.</p>\n<p>For example, according to Maersk, around 12%-15% of global containership capacity was effectively taken out of circulation by congestion in 2021, while Kuehne + Nagel noted 80% of the global sea freight disruption was associated with North American ports.</p>\n<p>Ti added: \u201cThe congestion in the ocean freight market continues to push traditional ocean shippers into the air freight market, adding to demand and driving up air freight rates.\u00a0The price difference between air and ocean had narrowed during the past year, making the shift to air slightly less costly than before the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, the average price of global air cargo was 12 times more expensive than sea shipping. Towards the end of 2021, the cost to move goods by air was about 2.5 times more expensive than pre-pandemic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the air freight industry still has its own capacity constraints to contend with, despite record numbers of charter flights from Asia laid on to carry e-commerce cargo.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdding air freight capacity to key tradelanes has been a key objective for forwarders over the past year,\u201d Ti noted, but added: \u201cDemand for air freight capacity continues to outstrip supply, contributing to increased yields and revenues among airlines.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven though air cargo capacity gradually increased during 2021 due to improvements in international passenger traffic, it was still 10.9% below 2019.\u201d</p>\n</article>"}
