Prices of vegetable oils have rocketed since Russia invaded agriculturally-rich Ukraine in February.</p>\n<p>However, this has not stopped palm oil sellers from attempting to sneak goods out of the country, especially with demand high in India, Pakistan and China, where importers are willing to pay far higher prices than Indonesian consumers.</p>\n<p><em>Mathu Bhum</em> was the sixth ship, but first container vessel, to be detained during the palm oil export ban. The others are chemical/products tankers <em>Annabelle</em>, <em>Toto XVI</em>, <em>World Progress and</em>\u00a0<em>W Blossom</em> and a tug, <em>Ever Sunrise</em>.</p>\n<p>Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest palm cultivator, producing 60% of the world\u2019s palm oil supplies.\u00a0Jakarta suspended palm oil exports after attempts to limit cooking oil prices, including a price ceiling and limits on the quantities of cooking oil for sale, only resulted in huge queues and cooking oil panic-buying.</p>\n</article>"}
