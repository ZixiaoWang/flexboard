That went to nothing and we are slowly having to build it back up, but this means charging our direct mail orders from the EU half the price, with us covering the VAT.\u201d</p>\n<p>A customs broker said that, for those moving lorryloads of goods, the additional costs of an \u201cextra couple of declarations probably aren\u2019t going to kill you\u201d.</p>\n<p>Explaining the breakdown, they said to assume cost of the export to Germany was \u00a325, plus \u00a335 for the import declaration and \u00a370 for the transit, but if the load was valued at \u00a325,000, the \u00a3130 cost of shipping amounted to just 0.52% of the load\u2019s value \u201cso, you wouldn\u2019t care\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow take someone that just wants to ship a pallet with a value of \u00a31,000 to Germany a few times a month.\u00a0You still pay \u00a3130 for the customs paperwork, but that is now 13% of the value of the goods.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotentially the small operator could look to ship less often, with bigger volumes, but that might not be possible. And so their potential profit is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Additional costs tied to Brexit stem not only from the need for customs declarations and transit documentation, but also administering EU accreditation processes and requirements.</p>\n<p>One forwarder said there was a \u201cwhole host\u201d of additional costs linked to certification on some goods, as well as being charged for security, customs checks and enforcement that \u201csimply weren\u2019t there\u201d for a generation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is without the potential for \u2018double-dipping\u2019 in duty already paid on previously imported products then sold on to end users, whether in the UK or the EU,\u201d the forwarder added.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnd users therefore have the option to either pay the costs that are passed through \u00a0\u2013 be they from the ferry operator, trucking company, customs brokerage or customs authorities \u2013 or to stop sourcing or supplying EU organisations or individuals under B2B or B2C models.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the government\u2019s perspective, the line remains it \u201cis still challenging to draw any firm conclusions\u201d on Brexit\u2019s long-term impact, citing the pandemic and other trade restrictions.\u00a0A government spokesperson told <em>The Loadstar</em>\u00a0February figures from the Office of National Statistics indicated that monthly exports to the EU were 3.1% above a pre-Covid average, and trade with the EU was growing throughout 2021.</p>\n<p>But the broker sought to challenge these claims of success, suggesting UK businesses were suffering while EU competitors had open access to UK trade.</p>\n<p>\u201cImport shipments do not need transit, which means an immediate saving. There are no real health certificate and examinations requirements on entry to the UK from the EU, which means the EU shipper has an advantage.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, it\u2019s known a lot of import declarations are not being made, and dropping requirements for phytosanitary controls due in July means easy circumvention of the import restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency Jacob Rees-Mogg announced in April that the phytosanitary import controls would not be introduced, citing rising costs to UK consumers which he put down to Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine.</p>\n<p>This, said the broker, meant the whole Brexit system coming from Whitehall was \u201cset against the UK exporter and not the importer\u201d.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the government spokesperson claimed: \u201c[Brexit] is the world\u2019s biggest zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal. It allows businesses in Britain to trade freely with Europe while also being able to seize new opportunities with countries around the world.\u00a0Through our export support service, expanded export academies and a landmark export strategy, we\u2019re ensuring businesses of all sizes have support to trade effectively with the EU.\u201d</p>\n<p>Responding directly to the government\u2019s comments, the record store owner pointed to \u201cmany glaring faults with this fatuous statement for most SMEs,\u201d not least of which was the claim the Brexit agreement would facilitate the chance to \u201cseize opportunities around the world\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe increased cost of transport means that for our product, the cost has increased three to four times,\u201d they said.\u00a0\u201cThen there are the cultural differences; we are simply not going to sell many jazz records in Indonesia or Thailand, and you have to take into account the poverty gap with these new global markets \u2013 Europe is rich, while Asia, Africa, South America are poor.</p>\n<p>\u201cSMEs can\u2019t wait 30 years for a vague \u2018levelling-up\u2019 promise. That\u2019s OK for the likes of Shell, ICI, Unilever, GM, but not for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Condemning the government\u2019s decision not to impose full import controls on the EU, the broker said that rather than the \u201cheralded trade facilitation measure\u201d it left Whitehall without any means of \u201cpushback on the EU\u201d to ensure the best deal for UK companies in EU markets.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt follows that the weakness of UK government serves to facilitate EU trade only,\u201d the broker added.\u00a0\u201cSo much for Britain winning back its border following Brexit. Rather the EU has gained a simple and effective way to limit UK exports without the same knock-on effect to EU exporters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asked if he could see any beacon of hope, the record store owner said he could only see benefit for politicians and big business interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrexit is essentially like Soviet communism: it sounds like a great idea, has true believers but hopefully it won\u2019t take 70 years to finally realise how damaging and stupidly pointless it all was.\u201d</p>\n</article>"}
