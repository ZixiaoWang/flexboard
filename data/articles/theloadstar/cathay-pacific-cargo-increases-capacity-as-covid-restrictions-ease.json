Restrictions on cross-border trucking have hampered the channels for transporting goods to Hong Kong in the Greater Bay area.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said the carrier had been making \u201cgood use of sea-air combined transport\u201d, getting goods into Hong Kong by sea and transferring them to the airport by truck.</p>\n<p>He added that the carrier and airport authority had been working to bring in goods from Dongguan Logistics Park, and delivering to the Haitian passenger terminal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis demonstrates the viable approach of sea-air intermodal transport and gives us confidence in continuing this programme,\u201d he said. \u201cThe use of waterways could increase some of the capacity, but it was still far below our expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p>As noted by the major freight forwarders in their Q1 results, the Covid lockdowns have significantly dented manufacturing output, with Kuhene + Nagel reporting exports from China down 15%.</p>\n<p>Mr Edmunds agreed it had \u201cseverely hit demand\u201d.</p>\n<p>Rates from Hong Kong to Europe have started to climb since 18 April, up 5% by 2 May; but to the US, they have fallen 6% since 25 April, according to the Tac Index.</p>\n<p><em>For more information on Chinese lockdowns and the impact on air cargo rates, listen to this clip from The Loadstar Podcast of Peyton Burnett, managing director of TAC Index.</em></p>\n<p/>\n<p><audio controls=\"controls\" data-project44-podcast-clip=\"true\"><source src=\"https://episodes.castos.com/61e078fee345f1-77268395/36802/4aaf256b-6764-44cd-8624-64559f21d2fa/Clip-4-EP6-2022.-Peyton-Burnett-Managing-Director-TAC-INDEX-explains-the-impact-of-Covid-lockdowns-in-China-on-the-global-air-cargo-market-.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>\n</article>"}
