And then even when that flying does return, it\u2019s probably not going to look the same as what it looked like prior to the pandemic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atlas gained a further 10 contracts in the first quarter, taking its long-term charter contracts to 25 in total, with \u201cthe majority going through to late 2024 or early 2024\u201d, with some as long as 2027. Just 4% of its capacity remains on the spot market.</p>\n<p>The carrier predicted that rates and yields in the second quarter would be similar to last year, but still well-above pre-pandemic levels. Happily for Atlas currently, yesterday, Xeneta reported that long-term contract rates are currently higher than the spot market. Atlas is also among those companies believing there will be a surge of exports once China reopens.</p>\n<p>The airline is also expecting new aircraft, with the first of the new 747-8Fs arriving this month, and \u201cvery strong interest for the new 777Fs\u201d. Mr Dietriech added that the carrier is also looking closely at new products from Airbus, the A350 and A330 conversions. \u201cFor the right opportunities, there is nothing that we can\u2019t fly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atlas, as expected, reported a strong <a href=\"https://www.atlasairworldwide.com/2022/05/atlas-air-worldwide-reports-strong-first-quarter-2022-results-and-full-year-outlook/\">set of results</a>, which it said reflected higher yields and its new and extended long-term contracts. However, revenue gains were partially offset by higher pilot costs following its new bargaining agreement. It was also the first time executives noted the rate of attrition among pilots, but said it \u201cfelt good\u201d about the pipeline, and that pilots could be attracted with new aircraft.</p>\n<p>Revenues grew 16% to $1bn in the quarter, while ebitda on an adjusted basis was up 11.8% to $202.8m. Net income grew 23% to $88.8m, despite volumes, on a block hour basis, falling 6%.</p>\n<p>The slow \u2013 but sure \u2013 return to growth in passenger flying was notable in <a href=\"https://investor-relations.lufthansagroup.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/financial-reports/interims-reports/LH-QR-2022-1-e.pdf\">Lufthansa Group\u2019s results</a>, which recorded a net loss of \u20ac584m, although that was a 44% improvement on a year earlier. Lufthansa Cargo was again the star of the show, with adjusted EBIT up 57% to \u20ac495m \u2013 it\u2019s highest ever first quarter.</p>\n<p>It cited ongoing disruption in global supply chains as a \u201cvery positive impact\u201d. Additional passenger flying saw capacity rise 24%, while revenue cargo tonne kilometres rose 10%. Load factors, however, were down nine percentage points, but revenues grew 50% to \u20ac1.32bn. Costs rose owing to fuel and belly expenses paid to the passenger division.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe performance of the Logistics segment is still at a record high; total market freight capacity continues to be down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent absence of belly capacities on passenger aircraft; demand for the remaining freight capacities remains very high; operating stability has been maintained despite a difficult operating environment, which included lockdowns in China and the southerly bypass of Russia,\u201d it said. Asia Pacific capacity was down 6%, while RTK in AP was down 10%.</p>\n<p>Lufthansa Cargo now operates a \u201cpermanently modified Airbus A321F\u201d, with a second to follow in the second half, which it said would benefit from increasing demand in ecommerce.</p>\n<p>Belly dependent IAG Cargo also reported results \u2013 with revenues up 23.4% to \u20ac432m, and yield up 2.3%. Sold tonnage rose 19%.</p>\n<p>\u201cDemand was particularly high between Europe and the USA for key industrial goods, including automotive parts, with\u00a0<span data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\">IAG</span>\u00a0Cargo increasing the availability of wide-body aircraft on European feeder lanes into Heathrow.\u00a0 Ecommerce has also remained a major driver of growth for\u00a0<span data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\">IAG</span>\u00a0Cargo, with high volumes being shipped into North America,\u201d it said.</p>\n<p>Striking a slightly different note to Atlas, IAG Cargo said: \u201cThe return to more widespread passenger flying has also provided a boost to cargo, with new routes opening up and capacity on important trade lanes increasing.\u201d</p>\n</article>"}
