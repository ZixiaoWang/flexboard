According to shippers, some 40% of Bangladeshi exports, mainly apparel, are ferried to mother vessels through Colombo port and Bangladeshi shippers are fearful of more major disruptions.</p>\n<p>Carrier MSC has some 8,500\u00a0Bangladesh-bound boxes stuck at Colombo\u00a0port, alongside thousands from other operators.</p>\n</article>"}
