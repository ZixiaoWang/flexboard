The carrier picks up pharmaceuticals, perishables and e-commerce in BRU, some of which is destined for the UK, but most of which then goes across the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>A mixture of challenges on EU-UK routes, including the long-running PO Ferries <a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/po-claims-all-is-well-but-ferry-pride-of-kent-fails-mca-inspection-again/\">debacle</a>, had made the route robust, said Mr Wardlaw.</p>\n<p>But along with the \u201ccommercial dynamics\u201d of maintaining the route, he acknowledged there were also slot portfolio dynamics.</p>\n<p>The impact of not overflying Russia has led to longer transit times on Virgin\u2019s flights to the subcontinent, which has, in turn, impacted aircraft and crew availability.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough crew for all our available slots, so the A321 allows us to use our slot portfolio,\u201d he explained.</p>\n<p>This summer, the EU is allowing a weakened \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 slot rule for cargo \u2013 70:30 instead of 80:20 (by which airlines must use their slots at least 70% of the time). But it is unlikely to be extended to the winter.</p>\n<p>Virgin is currently operating a near-daily service to BRU, and is looking to use its A321 on other routes as well, although having reviewed its Covid-era Norway route \u201ca few times\u201d, that doesn\u2019t look set to be one of them.</p>\n<p>But this is not a first step in Virgin becoming a freighter player,\u00a0said Mr Wardlaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do freighters long-term, perhaps we\u2019ll look at partnerships. But we are predominantly a passenger airline.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the passenger business is picking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe removal of restrictions on passengers has resulted in huge pent-up demand. The difference now is that passengers have much shorter booking windows than before. Where they might book a year in advance, now it is more likely to be a month in advance. We follow those trends closely, but it is more tricky than it used to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cargo\u2019s critical success in the past two years means it is playing a key role now in determining routes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe transition [back to passengers] is predominantly driven by passenger loads and economics. Cargo is playing a more significant part in new routes now,\u201d said Mr Wardlaw. And yields in cargo continue to thrive, he added: \u201cSea freight [disruption] has supported that demand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right now, the carrier is not flying to Asia outside of the Indian subcontinent, but it is waiting with interest to see if the ex-China market is ready to pick up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the intra-Asia supply chain issues can be resolved, and trucking, then we expect some real demand. We think Hong Kong will be sooner than Shanghai.\u201d And he said if demand was there, Virgin could operate cargo-only flights to take advantage.</p>\n<p>The focus \u2013 and cash \u2013 from cargo has allowed the carrier to make some investments. Virgin has not yet published its full 2021 annual report, (although its annual reports don\u2019t give much specific information). But it noted in a press release that while the carrier as a while recorded an ebitda loss of \u00a3166m for the year, on revenues of \u00a3928m, up \u00a360m on a year previously, cargo enjoyed revenues of \u00a3448m, up more than 200% since 2019, and 40% up on 2020.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you look at our performance, everyone has realised the importance of good, robust logistics. Cargo has really supported the survival of the airline \u2013 and it is important to invest.\u201d</p>\n<p>One investment that stalled as the pandemic struck was the carrier\u2019s IT upgrade. In June 2019, Virgin announced that it was opting for Accenture\u2019s product to replace its old Voyager system. But it had doubts, and despite partner AF-KLM opting for that system just a month later, Virgin changed its mind, and then decisions were halted by the onset of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe realised that system didn\u2019t quite align with what we needed,\u201d said Mr Wardlaw. \u201cBut Accelya\u2019s product was right for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The system will finally give Virgin a digital booking platform, with APIs that can be used for other digital marketplaces and customer systems. The integration started in January and is set to take about a year.</p>\n<p>\u201cLaunching at the right time is critical \u2013 we don\u2019t want to launch in the peak, and we want robust system testing in place first,\u201d explained Mr Wardlaw.</p>\n<p>The carrier is also investing in its Heathrow hub, opening the second phase of its cargo centre at dnata\u2019s City East, which is claimed to be the largest off-site cargo handling operation at LHR, and where it will share facilities with shareholder and joint venture partner Delta Cargo. Exports will stay at its Phase 1 facility, while imports will go to the new Phase II unit.</p>\n<p>This comes as the carrier\u2019s new fleet begins to arrive: an A330-900 coming in September and two more before the year-end, along with an A350; a further three A330-90s deliver next year, along with another A350; with four A330-900s arriving in 2024 \u2013 and another A350, as it phases out its older Boeing fleet.</p>\n<p>Cargo-friendly, and more fuel-efficient, the aircraft are also part of Virgin\u2019s plan to cut emissions. In line with others, it has a net zero strategy for 2050. This will also see it increase the amount of sustainable aviation fuel it uses via its deal with Neste. The pair announced in February a deal for 2.5 million litres of SAF for the first half of this year, and Virgin has pledged to use 10% SAF by 2030.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur customers are at a tipping point \u2013 and we are looking at where the cargo market is going to go [in terms of sustainability]. It\u2019s not quite as clear cut in cargo who the customers are, but we want to offer sustainable solutions and we want to start measuring. You\u2019ll see more from us on this throughout the year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Wardlaw appears to be off to a good start \u2013 he joined Cargo in January from Virgin\u2019s engineering department, where he spent seven years.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_208829\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-208829\" class=\"wp-image-208829 size-medium\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" src=\"https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2-210x150.jpg\" srcset=\"https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2-210x150.jpg 210w, https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2-420x300.jpg 420w, https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2-768x550.jpg 768w, https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2-1536x1100.jpg 1536w, https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-wardlaw-2-2048x1466.jpg 2048w\" width=\"210\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-208829\"><em>Phil Wardlaw</em></p></div>\n<p>\u201cFrom the outside you don\u2019t see how complex cargo is \u2013 it\u2019s a completely new world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic \u2013 it\u2019s a really interesting business and market.
