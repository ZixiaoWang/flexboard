It also hopes to provide a \u2018load-levelling\u2019 effect for wind and solar farms, which would serve to better utilise them, and drive adoption.</p>\n<p>Having bet heavily on LNG-powered ships for decarbonisation \u2013 an assumption now thought likely to be based on faulty logic \u2013 the pressure is on CMA CGM to find a drop-in replacement that will actually reduce its carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>And synthetic LNG is not its only option \u2013 the French carrier is also working with TotalEnergies and others on bioLNG, which is made using captured methane from landfills, sewage, and agricultural waste.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/ce_delft_3g84_biogas_beyond_2020_final_report.pdf\">A 2016 EU study</a> found that abundant bioLNG could be made available. The study considers four scenarios for biogas adoption \u2013 in the most aggressive scenario, production reaches a little over 40,000ktoe of biogas</p>\n<p>[ktoe refers to amount of energy needed to produce the equivalent of one tonne of crude oil.]</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/11099022/KS-HB-20-001-EN-N.pdf/bf891880-1e3e-b4ba-0061-19810ebf2c64\">European Energy data</a>, in 2018, shipping bunkered 40,469ktoe worth of all fuels across Europe, which means potentially all of Europe\u2019s shipping fuels could be met through biogas and potentially put a major dent in its maritime emissions.</p>\n<p>The EU study goes on to say that biogas offers the best decarbonisation bang-for-buck when used as a fuel for transport. \u201cThe best cost-effectiveness is achieved in the scenarios where the biogas is upgraded to biomethane and used as bio-CNG or bio-LNG, replacing diesel.</p>\n<p>\u201cUsing the biogas locally\u2026 or injecting it into the gas grid and then using it for heating reduces mostly natural gas consumption, whereas using it in transport will reduce diesel consumption mainly,\u201d it adds.</p>\n</article>"}
