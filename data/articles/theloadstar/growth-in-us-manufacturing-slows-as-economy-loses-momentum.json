Output was hampered by a combination of factors, primarily labour and parts shortages. The employment index was down 5.4 percentage points on the previous month. Companies reported a limited improvement in hiring numbers, but this was cancelled-out by higher numbers of employees leaving or retiring.</p>\n<p>Shortages of materials, parts and components have been the other major drag on output. Inputs continued to constrain production expansion, the ISM reported, noting that the supplier deliveries index indicates deliveries slowed at a faster rate in April, while the indices for inventories and imports show deceleration.</p>\n<p>Tim Fiore, chair of ISM\u2019s Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said: \u201cDeliveries slowed at a faster rate compared with the previous month. The index continues to reflect suppliers\u2019 difficulties in meeting demand from panelists\u2019 companies. April saw suppliers re-entering a labour-constrained environment, according to panelists\u2019 comments, and transportation networks are again demonstrating less flexibility.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he does not expect to see a significant improvement in the near future, adding:\u00a0\u201cImprovement in the index will be tepid for the rest of the second quarter due to continuing labour issues and the expected impact of recent China lockdowns.,\u201d</p>\n<p>Concern over the lockdowns in China are weighing heavily on the outlook for US manufacturing, said Mr Fiore.</p>\n<p>\u201cOverseas partners are experiencing Covid-19 impacts, creating a near-term headwind for the US manufacturing community. Fifteen percent of panelists\u2019 general comments expressed concern about their Asian partners\u2019 ability to deliver reliably in the summer months, up from 5% in March.\u201d he noted.</p>\n<p>One respondent observed that tier-two supplier shutdowns in Shanghai were causing a ripple effect for the firm\u2019s suppliers in other parts of China, while long delays at ports on both sides of the Pacific are still presenting supply challenges. In addition, rising inflation is stoking concerns that the economy will eventually have to give way.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with parts shortages, slower deliveries are taking a toll on inventory. The inventories index for April lost 3.9 percentage points from March, sinking to 51.6%.</p>\n<p>And at the same time, orders are slowing. The new orders index lost 0.3 percentage points from March, to reach 53.5%. Imports slipped 0.4% \u00a0to 51.4%, their lowest reading since October, while new export orders were down 0.5%, month on month, to 52.7%.</p>\n<p>According to Mr Fiore, export orders were suppressed due to the war in Ukraine and Covid-19 in Asia, while he expects import demand to be challenged through the second and third quarters from Covid-19 in Asia and the labour contract negotiations at the US west coast ports.</p>\n<p>Despite these setbacks, though, the ISM found expectations from respondents still predominantly upbeat, but the optimism has weakened. The ratio between upbeat and cautious comments in April was 3:1, down from 6:1 the month before.</p>\n</article>"}
