He claimed they had \u201cgouged American businesses by charging them ten times the usual shipping rates and have contributed toward the rise in inflation\u201d.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these same foreign carriers sought to use machines to move cargo rather than American workers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to a loss of jobs, automation poses a threat to national security as it places our ports at risk of being hacked, as other automated ports have experienced. These attempts should be a concern for our nation as the intention behind them isn\u2019t what\u2019s best for America, but rather what\u2019s best for foreign profits,\u201d wrote Mr Adams.</p>\n<p>A union spokewoman pointed to the hacking of the port of Durban in South Africa in 2021 and the 2017 NotPetya attack on Maersk\u2019s systems, including its terminals.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the ILWU said, documents such as the 2021 International Transport Forum report showed how automated terminals \u201care actually less efficient than those operated in a traditional manner\u201d.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the PMA, the employers\u2019 organisation that represents terminal operators on the west coast, has fired its own pre-negotiation salvo, claiming automation is the key to \u201cmore efficient and sustainable growth\u201d at the ports.</p>\n<p>Commissioned by the PMA, a study was conducted by Dr Michael Nacht, Professor of Public Policy at the University of California, and former Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Larry Henry, founder of ContainerTrac.</p>\n<p>The study raised concerns that congestion and delays at Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle 40% of US imports from Asia, will see freight shifting to east coast terminals.</p>\n<p>Studying two automated terminals at the ports, the report claims automated terminals process cargo faster, with some 44% greater throughput per acre than non-automated terminals.\u00a0In addition, due to growth, more jobs, with higher skillsets, were required at the automated ports to handle the increased volumes between 2015 and 2021.</p>\n<p>According to the PMA study: \u201cPaid ILWU hours at the two automated terminals rose 31.5%, more than twice the 13.9% growth in paid hours at the non-automated terminals.\u00a0Registered ILWU workforce in Los Angeles and Long Beach grew 11.2%, compared with 8.4% for the other 27 west coast ports.\u201d</p>\n<p>The report also claims automation brings health benefits to workers as well as the local communities by reducing emissions through using electrified equipment and offering rapid turn around times for diesel-powered trucks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAutomation is a global trend and the hallmark of the world\u2019s most advanced ports,\u201d concluded the PMA report.</p>\n<p>Recently, James McKenna, PMA president and CEO, said automation was a key tool in managing larger volumes at terminals. However, he was also confident a deal would be agreed as the pandemic had meant greater co-operation between employers and union staff.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, he said, old-fashioned wages, working conditions and hours would be the \u201cchallenging issues\u201d for the negotiators.</p>\n<p>This year\u2019s contract negotiations may have the air of modernity versus the sterile stagnation of yesteryear, but \u00a0both sides understand that the other side needs to protect its membership.\u00a0If the negotiations are to be successful, both sides need to show they are able to achieve a creditable compromise.</p>\n<p><em>For more analysis on the west coast negotiations, check out our Deep Dive Podcast on the subject.</em></p>\n<p><audio controls=\"controls\" data-project44-podcast-clip=\"true\"><source src=\"https://episodes.castos.com/61e078fee345f1-77268395/36763/c46b6a36-379b-4ed6-9aa5-7c177520ccbd/Deep-DIVE-PMA-ILWU-v9.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>\n</article>"}
