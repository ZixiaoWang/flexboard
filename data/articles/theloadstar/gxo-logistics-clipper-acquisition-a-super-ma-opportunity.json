GXO expects to complete the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, by late summer.</p>\n<p>Chief executive Malcolm Wilson was speaking at a conference call with analysts yesterday, following the release of its first quarter results, the highlights of which included an increase in revenue of 14% year-on-year, comprising organic (revenue) growth of 19% and record Q1 new business wins, mostly on the back of a boom in first-time outsourcing, as chief strategy officer Neil Shelton <a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/supply-chain-radar-gxo-logistics-in-the-value-basket/\">revealed</a> to <em>Loadstar Premium</em>.</p>\n<p>Asked about the generally recognised high price GXO is paying for Clipper and the strategic rationale behind the acquisition, Mr Wilson replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the business was spun-off, we created a list of companies that we thought would make really super MA opportunities and Clipper was right at the top. So we were super pleased to have reached an agreement (to acquire the company).</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very accretive for our business. Even in the first year, it\u2019s going to be accretive. We\u2019re paying a good price for it, yes, but it\u2019s coming with just an absolute ton of cost synergies \u2013 about $48 million.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s also bringing a reinforcement of e-fulfilment in the core markets we operate in and there is virtually no crossover of customers. So, there\u2019s a massive opportunity for cross sales across the customer base and a lot of Clipper\u2019s customers are multinational and do not just have a UK activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wilson went on to highlight that Clipper is very advanced, more so even than GXO, when it comes to reverse logistics and returns management. \u201cIt\u2019s a real skill and an art for them. They\u2019ve got a lot of very sophisticated software that drives it. Leveraging those skill sets and technologies across the rest of GXO\u2019s customer base, not just in the UK and continental Europe, but even in North America, is going to help us tremendously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wilson also said Clipper would enlarge GXO\u2019s footprint in Germany, Europe\u2019s largest single economy.</p>\n<p>\u201cGermany is on our list of MA target countries. It\u2019s a market that\u2019s very open to outsourcing. When we think of our business today in Germany it\u2019s very small but for Clipper, it\u2019s bigger. When you put both together, you get a real critical mass.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if we see accelerating growth in Germany on the same scale as the rest of our business \u2013 wow, that\u2019s going to be incredible for us.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big market dominated by a handful of players at the moment, plenty of room for a new technology-driven organization like GXO,\u201d he added.</p>\n</article>"}
