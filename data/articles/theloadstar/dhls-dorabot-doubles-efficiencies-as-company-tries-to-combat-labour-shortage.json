DHL says the robot can sort packages within 3.6 seconds, on average, with \u201cclose to zero\u201d errors.</p>\n<p>The system has two configurations: sort-to-bag; and sort-to-gaylord \u2013 a gaylord is a bulk-sized corrugated cardboard container, generally mounted on a pallet or wheeled trolley.</p>\n<p>The Atlanta system uses 20 gaylord containers positioned around the robot. The system detects when the container is full and notifies an operative when it needs to be swapped. The robot\u2019s working area is surrounded by a light curtain for safety reasons.</p>\n<p>Surveys by DHL of its global workforce identified considerable challenges for logistics companies, including a shortage of staff, with potential applicants presuming that their jobs will be automated in a few years\u2019 time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are facing a labour shortage, in driving and warehousing,\u201d said Klaus Dohrmann, VP innovation Europe  trend research.</p>\n<p>Dr Dohrmann added that certain jobs in logistics, such as last-mile delivery, were challenging to automate \u201canytime soon\u201d, and DHL expects that, by 2024, \u201conly 10% of last-mile deliveries will be automated, because of the complex environment on the last mile\u201d.</p>\n<p>He said: \u201cWhat I find interesting is that wages are not, apparently, as important as these soft topics \u2013 sustainability, corporate social responsibility and providing home-working opportunities.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an interesting finding that we need to consider in our approaches. As a company, we have to think about how to be an attractive employer\u2026 more than 50% of the people surveyed believed technological advancement could be a threat to their jobs and careers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a certain tendency to talk about automation \u2013 replacing humans. But in logistics, there is a complex task and a broad variety of tasks. There is much better value in augmenting human beings with technology,\u201d he added.</p>\n</article>"}
