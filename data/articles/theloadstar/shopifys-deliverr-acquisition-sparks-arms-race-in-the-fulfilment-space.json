Among its customers are Amazon and Walmart.</p>\n<p>A strength of Deliverr is its use of predictive analytics to anticipate demand for products, and pre-position them close to areas of anticipated demand as well as to determine the best delivery method.</p>\n<p>The takeover, which marks the largest acquisition in Shopify\u2019s history to date, gives the new owners the possibility to mount next-day and two-day services. According to Shopify CFO Amy Shapero, merchants will shortly see a badge for their sites appearing on multiple platforms that will allow next-day and two-day shipping options.</p>\n<p>This will be offered to merchants that are Shopify clients as well as non-aligned sellers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal is to not only level the playing field for independent businesses, but tilt it in their favour \u2013 turning their size and agility into a superpower,\u201d said Shopify founder and CEO Tobi L\u00fctke.</p>\n<p>Coming a month after Amazon launched its Buy with Prime service intended to include online sellers not with Amazon, Shopify\u2019s move has prompted comments about an \u201carms race\u201d in the fulfilment space.</p>\n<p>The smaller firm certainly has some ground to cover, as its fulfilment capabilities have been described as \u201cunderwhelming\u201d. Management announced plans for a proprietary fulfilment service back in 2019, but little happened except for the $450m acquisition of warehouse management systems provider 6 River Systems in 2020. Initially for merchants, participation in the Shopify Fulfilment Network (SFN) was by invitation, and the scheme never formally advanced beyond the beta test phase.</p>\n<p>There was some movement earlier in the year when it transpired that Shopify was parting company with some of the final-mile providers it was working with.</p>\n<p>Management signalled that it was going to develop its own network of larger distribution centres \u201cin key US geographies\u201d that would be controlled and operated by Shopify itself. The overarching objective behind this was to establish capability to serve 90% of the US population with deliveries within two days or less.</p>\n<p>Now it looks like management had second thoughts about a network of proprietary facilities and is pursuing an asset-light strategy instead, which would seem plausible in light of soaring warehouse costs.</p>\n<p>Matt Hertz, CEO of e-commerce supply chain solutions provider Second Marathon, called Deliverr complementary to Shopify\u2019s network, but questioned if the acquisition signalled that the company would scrap its \u2018build it thyself\u2019 approach unveiled in February.</p>\n<p>Management has stated that it plans to integrate Deliverr with SFN and 6 River Systems into a logistics unit to be led by Aaron Brown, who has been at the helm of SFN since 2020.</p>\n<p>It also announced that it expects the installation of its warehouse management system to be completed across its facilities by the end of the second quarter.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt pairs perfectly together and what we end up with in the end is this merchant-obsessed platform,\u201d remarked Shopify president Harley Finkelstein. \u201cWe\u2019re simplifying logistics along every stage.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was speaking when the company tabled its results for the first quarter. Revenue was up 22% to $1.2bn, but the bottom line showed a net loss of $1.5bn, down from net income of $1.3bn a year earlier. Shares in the company dropped 16% after the results presentation, which had fallen short of analysts\u2019 expectations.</p>\n<p>The going is getting tougher and Shopify could do with a coherent and efficient fulfilment network that can keep costs down.</p>\n<p><em>For more information, check out the Deep Dive: Ecommerce podcast, <a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/the-deep-dive-podcast-e-commerce-is-where-the-gold-lies-for-those-in-global-logistics/\">here</a>.\u00a0</em></p>\n</article>"}
