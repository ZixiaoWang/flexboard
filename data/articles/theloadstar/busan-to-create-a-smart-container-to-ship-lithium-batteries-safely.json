However, lithium batteries, especially, have been known to burst into flames, causing port authorities and ship operators to require such cargo to be declared as dangerous goods.</p>\n<div class=\"middle-banner\">\n<div class=\"ad-box\">\n<div class=\"ad-top\"><a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/plugins/adrotate-pro/adrotate-out.php?track=NzQ1LDE0NSwwLGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaWN0c2kuY29t\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/ictsi-web-banner-ad_v4_600x150-040721.gif\"/></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Busan\u2019s authorities said that, with real-time monitoring, it was possible to reduce the risk of explosion during transport and to pre-empt fires by developing special container materials to increase insulation and flame retardancy.</p>\n<p>Busan\u2019s Digital Economy Innovation Office head, Lee Joon-seung, said, \u201cBusan processes more than 90% of the country\u2019s lithium-ion battery imports and exports, so the development of container technology for safe battery transport is essential. By securing safety, the status of Busan as an international port and logistics city will be enhanced.\u201d</p>\n<p>The consequences of lithium-fuelled fires can be worse than others as they are very difficult to extinguish, prone to thermal runaway and present a risk of explosion. And, due to the heat generated, re-ignition after a fire has been extinguished is another major risk.</p>\n<p>The growing number of shipments of lithium batteries have led insurer TT Club to last month <a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/know-your-shipper-warns-tt-club-as-lithium-battery-fires-spread/\">call for greater vigilance</a>.</p>\n<p>Risk management director Peregrine Storrs-Fox said: \u201cThe majority of shippers will take all practicable steps to ensure that their lithium batteries achieve certification and are classified, packaged, packed, labelled and declared correctly. A small \u2013 frankly criminal \u2013 minority are motivated to avoid compliance, entering cargo into the supply chain that presents great risk to all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce lithium batteries are placed into the intermodal supply chain, there is little opportunity for the cargo to be checked, visually or otherwise, to verify compliance.\u201d</p>\n</article>"}
