It\u2019s a large and diverse customer base, of not just manufacturers, but installers, and also reverse logistics. E-commerce makes it even more complex.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said companies should make thorough checks on those shipping lithium ion batteries.</p>\n<p>\u201cVerify who you are dealing with. Is it a new customer? Documentation should be available, the regulations mean they must be tested. You should also check manufacturing sites, use Google maps to make sure it\u2019s actually a factory.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said getting shipper battery associations to help define \u201cwho is good\u201d would be useful. \u201cWe need to know who is less scrupulous \u2013 it\u2019s a small percentage but it\u2019s hard to squeeze them out of the marketplace.\u201d</p>\n<p>He acknowledged that the checks would be a significant task, but said each supply chain partner could do their part. He also noted developments in machine learning and AI which could help.</p>\n<p>\u201cA number of entities are working to make the information flow smoother, and you could use independent checks to verify all those details.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, he acknowledged there were many challenges, adding:\u00a0\u201cThere are some concerns over antitrust if companies come together to share knowledge. Safety does need a common approach, otherwise the weakest link will fail, or come in via the backdoor on another carrier.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut each company is different, and approaches things in different ways, so it\u2019s hard to get an agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p>He cited Hapag-Lloyd\u2019s Cargo Patrol software, which automatically helps identify undeclared or suspicious cargo. Hapag-Lloyd passed it on to IBM, which offers it to other lines.</p>\n<p>\u201cGiving it to an independent entity is the right approach,\u201d said Mr Storrs-Fox. \u201cBut it actually hasn\u2019t got much further. Zim has created a similar one, and Exis Technologies now has a common tool it has installed for two or three shipping lines, onto which they can add their own approach.\u201d</p>\n<p>But there is a long way to go.\u00a0The TT Club is \u201cdoing a deep dive on the science\u201d, he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want a single document that explains the properties of lithium. Then we will look at the regulations, which have been built around different lobbying, which isn\u2019t always the right way. We will frame the regulations based on the science.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt needs real rigour at a regulatory level. Current provisions are convoluted. We need to go back to first principles and then unpick the regulations to find the fault lines.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, other work includes looking at fire suppression.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuppression or control is uncertain at this stage. We need to look at how ships can tackle it. Firefighting on ships has been in the crosshairs for some time, and it will require consideration at the ship building, design and classification stages.\u201d</p>\n<p>The air cargo industry, frustrated by lack of oversight outside of aviation, has been clamouring for governments to criminalise shippers who fail to ship dangerous goods correctly, or ship dangerous counterfeits.</p>\n<p>Mr Storrs-Fox agreed that this was important, but again pointed to numerous challenges.</p>\n<p>\u201cDifferent jurisdictions are organised differently. Legislative structures are different. It\u2019s frustrating. Individual groups can be lobbying at the UN level for the legislative environment, but then it will be inconsistently applied in different countries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Optimistically, Mr Storrs-Fox said he could see a change being implemented \u201cat the Geneva level\u201d by the end of next year. But there would then be deliberations for each mode, and the process could take another year or two.</p>\n<p>Establishing firefighting processes could take a \u201cdecade, probably\u201d, he said, adding:\u00a0\u201cBut the industry could and should work faster on something workable and effective.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe processes should be started by the industry, and moved forward so that regulations can catch up. Hopefully we will start to see some change. But it will probably see out my career,\u201d he added.</p>\n</article>"}
