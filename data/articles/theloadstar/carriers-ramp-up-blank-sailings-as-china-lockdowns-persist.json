In the same vein, a drastic reduction in export freight to the port has meant fewer containers can be shipped out of Shanghai, mellowing export dwell times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, ocean carriers have succeeded in discharging their empty equipment at Shanghai in readiness for the surge of cargo that will follow the ending of the strictly enforced Covid lockdowns, in which the city\u2019s 25m inhabitants are now entering their seventh week.</p>\n<p>And Maersk reported today that reefer cargo yard density at Shanghai had improved considerably, adding in an advisory:\u00a0\u201cWe will re-start the booking acceptance for Shanghai, with the first cargo accepted to arrive in Shanghai from 26 June onwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>It said warehouse operations in Shanghai had been \u201cpartially resumed\u201d, although in Ningbo warehouses were \u201copen for now\u201d, but subject to strict health codes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCargo will not be accepted if drivers have been to medium- or high-risk areas in the last 14 days,\u201d it warned.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as a consequence of the export cargo disruptions in China and the resulting cancellations of sailings, cargo lead times from Asia to North Europe continue to grow, with the UK suffering the worst impact due to the port rationalisation strategies of the carriers.</p>\n<p>Project44 data shows lead times from China to North Europe and the UK have increased by 20% and 27%, respectively, in the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>This reinforces the complaints to <em>The Loadstar</em> of one UK forwarder who claimed that cargo destined for Felixstowe, Southampton and London Gateway was \u201cregularly being dumped at other ports on the continent without any proper plan to relay the containers\u201d.</p>\n<p>Another forwarder lambasted Maersk for its service, citing two containers delayed \u00a0for more than a month at different European ports after being shipped from Asia on the same vessel.</p>\n</article>"}
